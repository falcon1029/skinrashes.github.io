<h2>What is shingles?</h2>

<p>
    Shingles (also known as herpes zoster) is a painful blistering rash caused by the same virus that causes
    chickenpox (the varicella zoster virus).

     <h2>What causes shingles?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    If you have had chickenpox the virus that caused it may live on afterwards in a dormant state in the nerves
    linked to your spinal cord. If the virus becomes active again, it will multiply and move along the nerve fibres
    to the area of skin supplied by those nerves; shingles then appears in this area. About 20% of people who have
    had chickenpox will have an attack of shingles later in life.<br><br>

    Shingles is not caught from someone who has shingles, but follows an earlier attack of chickenpox. However, a
    person with shingles can infect someone who has never had chickenpox, causing an attack of chickenpox but not shingles.
<br><br>
    Most attacks of shingles occur for no obvious reason, but an attack is more likely if:<br><br>
<ul>

<li>you are elderly. </li>
<li>you are under stress. </li>
<li>you have an illness that weakens the immune system, such as leukaemia, a lymphoma (for example,
    Hodgkin’s disease), or HIV. </li>
<li>you are taking treatments that suppress the immune system, including irradiation for cancer, chemotherapy,
    cortisone-like drugs, and drugs taken to prevent organ rejection. </li>

</ul>
<h3>Is shingles hereditary?</h3>
<p>
    No.

     <h2>What are the symptoms of shingles?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Pain is the first and predominant symptom and sometimes there is also a tingling or burning sensation.
    The rash usually appears a day or two after these symptoms. You may also feel ill and have a fever and a headache.

     <h2>What does shingles look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The first sign is the appearance of groups of red spots on a pink-red background, which quickly turn into
    small fluid-filled blisters. Some of the blisters burst, others fill up with blood or pus. The area then
    slowly dries out, and crusts and scabs form. The scabs will drop off over the next 2-3 weeks.
<br><br>
    The rash usually covers a well-defined area of skin on one side of the body only, and not crossing the midline.
    Its position and shape will depend on which nerves are involved. Shingles can affect any area, but common
    patterns include a band running round one side of the chest, or down an arm or leg. Sometimes pale or dark
    scars follow shingles, particularly after a severe attack.
<br><br>
    A chickenpox-like rash occasionally comes up at the same time as shingles.  This may indicate a more serious and
    widespread attack of shingles or that there is an underlying reason for the shingles.

     <h2>How is shingles diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Early in the course of shingles, before the rash is present, it may be difficult to make the diagnosis.
    Later on the diagnosis is usually straightforward, based on the story of pain appearing before the rash,
    and on the typical appearance of the rash.<br><br>

    It takes several days to grow the virus in the laboratory to test for shingles so it is not often done as
    treatment needs to be started quickly. If there is doubt about the diagnosis, scrapings may be taken from a
    blister and looked at under a microscope.

     <h2>Can shingles be cured?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Shingles resolves on its own within a few weeks. Oral medication  can make the rash of shingles clear more
    quickly and can reduce its unpleasant effects.<br><br>

    These effects depend largely on which nerve is involved:<br><br>

<ul>

    <li>Shingles of the area served by the nerve that carries sensation from the front of the eye can lead to ulceration
        there, and later to scarring.  Blisters coming up on the side of your nose will alert your doctor to this risk,
        and you should get advice from an eye specialist.</li>
    <li>Muscles supplied by the nerves taking part in the shingles occasionally become weak. For example, a temporary
        facial paralysis can accompany a shingles rash on the ear.</li>
    <li>The pain of shingles may persist long after the rash has cleared (post herpetic neuralgia), particularly in
        the elderly. Usually this goes away within 6 months, but a few people are in pain for a year or more.</li>

</ul>

     <h2>Is shingles contagious?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

    Shingles itself is not caught from someone who has shingles. It develops
    when the dormant herpes zoster virus becomes active, for example when a
    person’s immune defences are weaker than normal. However, a person with
    shingles can pass on chickenpox to someone who has never had chickenpox.
    A person with shingles is infectious from the point of blister development up
    until the blisters crust over (approximately 7 days).

     <h2>How can shingles be treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<ul>
    <li>To shorten the attack. Antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir tablets and/or
        cream, are safe and can do this, but only if they are given within the
        first few days of an attack. Therefore it is very important to get an early
        diagnosis. </li>
    <li>To make it less painful. Rest and taking pain-killers may help, i.e. nonsteroidal,
        anti-inflammatories, applying a cool compress.
    </li>
    <li>To deal with complications. A bacterial infection complicating shingles
        may require an antibiotic cream or tablets. Eye involvement will need a
        specialist ophthalmic review, and eye drops may be prescribed.</li>
    <li>To prevent postherpetic neuralgia. Taking antiviral drugs during an
        attack of shingles may reduce the risk of getting postherpetic neuralgia,
        and can shorten its duration if it does occur. </li>
    <li>To treat the pain of postherpetic neuralgia. Using an anaesthetic
        ointment (lidocaine 5%) before applying a topical analgesic cream
        (capsaicin cream) may help. The lidocaine can be bought over the
        counter, but the capsaicin needs to be prescribed by your doctor.
        Treatments that are sometimes also used include antidepressants, and
        anticonvulsants, as well as pain killers, such as non-steroidal antiinflammatory
        drugs; all of these treatments should be prescribed by
        your doctor, and will depend on each individual case</li>
    <li>The live varicella–zoster vaccines are licensed for immunisation
        against chickenpox in high risk people. They are not recommended for
        routine use in children. Rarely, the varicella–zoster vaccine virus has
        been transmitted from the vaccinated individual to close contacts.

     <h2>Self help (What can I do?)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<ul>
<li>High risk people such as newborn babies, elderly people, people with
    reduced immunity, and those who have not previously had chickenpox
    (especially pregnant women) should avoid contact with shingles until
    the blisters crust over.
</li>
<li>See your doctor as early as possible if you think you have shingles,
    particularly of the face, as antiviral treatment works best if taken early
    in an attack. </li>
<li>You may need to take time off work initially; however, you can return to
    work once the rash has dried out and crusted over.</li>
<li>Rest if not working; if you have a temperature, you may need bed rest
    for a few days.</li>
