<h2>What is contact dermatitis?</h2>
<p>
    The words ‘dermatitis’ and ‘eczema’ are interchangeable and mean the same thing.  Contact dermatitis, therefore, is the same thing as contact eczema.
    For simplicity we will stick to the word ‘dermatitis’ in this leaflet.
<br><br>
    Dermatitis means an inflammation of the skin. The term ‘contact dermatitis’ is used when this inflammation is
    caused by contact with something in the environment.

      <h2>What causes contact dermatitis?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Two main groups of things in the environment cause contact dermatitis: irritants and allergens.
    <br><br>

    Irritants are substances like detergents and solvents that strip the skin of its natural oils, and cause dermatitis to develop if
    contacted frequently and without skin protection. When this happens, the skin changes are known as an irritant contact dermatitis.
    The most important factor in causing this type of contact dermatitis is the amount of irritants to which you are exposed.
    It is particularly common in people who do a lot of wet work, for example nurses, hairdressers, those who work in bars,
    and those in the catering trade.
    <br><br>

    Allergens are things to which your immune system can develop a specific reaction after you have come into contact with them.
    Examples include substances such as nickel, rubber, and perfumes or preservatives used in some creams and cosmetics.
    This type of dermatitis is called an allergic contact dermatitis.  It is not known why some people who are exposed to
    these allergens develop it while others do not.
    Sometimes substances such as proteins in fruit and vegetables can cause an immediate allergic reaction leading to itchy
    skin swellings known as contact urticaria (hives), which in turn can aggravate your dermatitis.
    Contact dermatitis cannot be caught from nor spread to other people.

      <h2>Is contact dermatitis hereditary?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    People with a tendency to asthma, eczema and hay fever develop irritant contact dermatitis more easily than others, and this tendency does run in families.

      <h2>What are the symptoms of contact dermatitis?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Itching of the skin is the commonest symptom, and this can be intense. Sometimes the skin becomes sore, and painful
    cracks can develop over the backs of the fingers when dermatitis affects the hands.

      <h2>What does contact dermatitis look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The commonest areas on which contact dermatitis occurs are the hands, arms, face and legs. During a flare, contact
    dermatitis inflames the skin surface making it look red and scaly. Sometimes, tiny water blisters develop and these
    leak fluid when scratched. When the contact dermatitis is less active, the skin looks thick and dry, and painful
    little cracks can form over joints.

      <h2>How will it be diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Irritant contact dermatitis is diagnosed simply by knowing which irritant substances your skin is exposed to, and how often this occurs.
    Allergic contact dermatitis is diagnosed by a procedure available in specialist dermatology departments known as patch testing.
    This involves putting sticky patches containing different substances on your back. The patches are taken off 2 days later,
    and the doctor or patch test nurse will then look at your back to see which ones have reacted. They will need to look again
    after a further 48 hours to see if there are further reactions.

<div class="card">
    <div class="header">
      <h2>Can contact dermatitis be cured?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Yes - if you can greatly reduce your contact with irritants, then your irritant contact dermatitis will improve or clear.
    If patch testing shows that you are allergic to a specific allergen, then avoiding that allergen will
    usually lead to a big improvement or even complete clearance of your allergic contact dermatitis.

      <h2>Treatment for contact dermatitis </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<p>
    There are several ways to treat contact dermatitis, including:
    <ul>
    <li>reducing your exposure to irritants</li>
    <li>avoiding allergens</li>
    <li>emollients</li>
    <li>topical corticosteroids (steroid ointments and creams)</li>
    <li>steroid tablets </li>
</ul>
These are explained below.
</p>
<h3>Avoiding the cause</h3>
<p>
    One of the most important steps in treating contact dermatitis is identifying and avoiding the allergens or
    irritants that affect you. If you can successfully avoid or reduce your exposure to the cause, you shouldn't experience any symptoms.
    <br><br>
    It's not always easy to avoid irritants or allergens that affect you, but your GP or dermatologist (specialist in treating
    skin conditions) can find ways to minimise your contact with them.
    <br><br>
    If you're exposed to irritants as part of your job, wear protective clothing to minimise any contact. Tell your employer
    about your condition, so they can help you avoid the causes as much as possible.
</p>

<h3>Emollients</h3>
<p>
    Emollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film.
    They're often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as eczema.
	<br><br>


Several different emollients are available. You may need to try a few to find one that works for you. You may also be
advised to use a mix of emollients, such as:
<ul>
    <li>an ointment for very dry skin</li>
    <li>a cream or lotion for less dry skin</li>
    <li>an emollient to use instead of soap</li>
    <li>an emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower</li>
    <li>one emollient to use on your face and hands, and a different one to use on your body</li>
</ul>

The difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil they contain. Ointments contain the most oil,
so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin. Lotions contain the least amount
of oil, so aren't greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between.
<br><br>
Creams and lotions tend to be more suitable for red, inflamed (swollen) areas of skin. Ointments are more suitable for areas of dry skin that aren't inflamed.
If you've been using a particular emollient for some time, it may eventually become less effective or may start to irritate your skin.
    If this is the case, your GP can prescribe another product.

</p>

<h3>Topical corticosteroids</h3>
<p>
    If your skin is very red, sore and inflamed, your GP may prescribe a topical corticosteroid (a cream or ointment applied
    directly to your skin), which can quickly reduce the inflammation.
    When used as instructed by your pharmacist or doctor, corticosteroids are a safe and effective treatment for contact dermatitis.
    <br><br>

    Different strengths of topical corticosteroids can be prescribed, depending on the severity of your contact dermatitis and where the affected skin is.
    You may be prescribed:
    <ul>
    <li>a stronger cream for short-term use in severe contact dermatitis</li>
    <li>a weaker cream if the eczema is mild</li>
    <li>a weaker cream for use on your face, genitals or in the creases of your joints (such as your elbows), as your skin is thinner in these areas</li>
    <li>a stronger cream to use on your palms and the soles of your feet, as the skin is thicker here</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3>Steroid tablets</h3>
<p>
    If you have a severe episode of contact dermatitis and it covers a large area of your skin,
    your doctor may prescribe corticosteroid tablets.<br><br>
    You may be prescribed steroid tablets to take for five to seven days. Depending on how effective this is, your dose may then be
    may gradually reduced over two to three weeks.
    If steroid tablets are taken often or for a long time, they can cause a number of side effects, such as:
    <ul>
    <li>reduced growth rate in children</li>
    <li>reduced growth rate in children</li>
    <li>high blood pressure (hypertension)</li>
    <li>osteoporosis (brittle bones)</li>
    <li>diabetes</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h3>Further treatments</h3>

<p>
    If the treatments prescribed by your GP aren't successfully controlling your symptoms, they may refer you for
    assessment and treatment by a dermatologist.<br><br>
    Further treatments that may be available from your dermatologist include:
    <ul>
    <li>phototherapy – where the affected area of skin is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light to help improve its appearance</li>
    <li>immunosuppressant therapy – medicines that reduce inflammation by suppressing your immune system</li>
    <li>alitretinoin – capsules licensed for severe eczema affecting the hands</li>
</ul>
