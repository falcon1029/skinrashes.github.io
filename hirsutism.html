     <h1>Hirsutism</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

<h2>What is hirsutism?</h2>

<p>
    Hirsutism refers to excessive growth of dark, thick and coarse hair in an individual (usually female)
    in a male pattern. Commonly affected areas are upper lips, chin, central chest, midline of the stomach,
    lower back, buttocks and front of thighs. Hirsutism affects approximately 10% of women in Western societies
    and is commoner in those of Mediterranean or Middle-Eastern descent.<br><br>

    If the excessive hair is generalised and not in a gender specific pattern, the term is ‘hypertrichosis’,
    which means increased (‘hyper’) hair (‘trichosis’). In this leaflet we will only discuss hirsutism.

     <h2>What causes hirsutism?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Androgens are often thought of as 'male hormones' but, in fact, both men and women produce them -
    men usually in greater amounts than women. Testosterone is the best-known androgen, but there are
    several others too. Hirsutism can be caused either by abnormally high levels of androgens, or by
    the hair follicles being more sensitive than usual to normal androgen levels.
<br><br>
    A small minority of women with hirsutism produce too much androgen and sometimes this is due to an
    underlying medical condition. In addition, some medicines can cause hirsutism - these include hormones,
    anabolic steroids, and sometimes oral contraceptive pills.
<br><br>
    In fact, most women with hirsutism have no hormone imbalance or underlying medical condition. Many
    women develop more facial or body hair gradually as they get older, especially after the menopause.
    Few realise how common this is - but at least 25% of normal middle-aged women remove unwanted facial hair.
    In addition, women from different ethnic backgrounds have different patterns of hair growth, in which it
    can be normal to have some hair on the face, nipples or stomach.



<h3>Is hirsutism hereditary?</h3>
<p>
    A tendency to hirsutism does run in some families and is not associated with an excess of androgens.
    It is normal in some families with Mediterranean or Middle Eastern ancestry.
</p>

<h3>What are the symptoms of hirsutism?</h3>
<p>
    Having too much hair can be highly embarrassing and cause great distress.
</p>

<h3>What does hirsutism look like?</h3>
<p>
    The excess of thick, often dark, hair may be seen on the face, chest, abdomen and upper back.
    Women from certain ethnic groups tend to have more body hair than others and for them it
    may be quite normal to have some hair in these areas.

     <h2>How will hirsutism be diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Women with mild hirsutism and regular menstrual cycles seldom have an underlying medical problem.
    However, if a medical problem exists, your doctor should be able to detect it by asking you
    questions and then, if necessary, by performing blood tests.
<br><br>
    It is important to see your doctor if your hirsutism is:<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>Severe </li>
    <li>Developing quickly (over 1-2 years), or before puberty </li>
    <li>Accompanied by menstrual problems </li>
    <li>Associated with features suggesting an increase in androgens such as thinning of the
        scalp hair, baldness, or deepening of the voice </li>
    <li>Accompanied by obesity or diabetes </li>

</ul>

     <h2>Can hirsutism be cured?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Although a ‘cure’ is unlikely, local areas of excessive hair growth can often be cleared by electrolysis
    or laser therapy. The treatment of hirsutism with medication is usually less satisfactory as the problem
    often comes back when treatment stops.

     <h2>How can hirsutism be treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<p>
    In the rare cases where there is an underlying hormonal disorder, the
    treatment is of the underlying disease.
    <br><br>
    Treatments for hirsutism where there is no underlying cause or in association
    with PCOS include:

</p>



<h3>1.Physical treatments</h3>
<p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Electrolysis.</b>An electrical current is passed into a hair follicle through a
        needle. The aim is to destroy the hair root permanently. Electrolysis is
        relatively expensive and time-consuming. Before you have electrolysis,
        check that the operator is properly qualified, and registered with the
        Institute of Electrolysis. Check that the practitioner uses new,
        disposable (not simply re-sterilised) needles. Equipment designed for
        electrolysis at home are not recommended. Scarring is a potential side
        effect of this treatment. It is not always available on the NHS.
    </li>
    <li><b>Laser and intense pulsed light (IPL) treatments</b>also aim to destroy the
        hair root permanently. They are not always available on the NHS.
        Laser treatment and IPL are expensive and several treatments are
        given over a period of months. This form of hair reduction must be
        done at a special clinic by an operator who is properly qualified. Check
        that they are registered with the Healthcare Commission or British
        Medical Laser Association. It is better to take the route of a referral
        from your medical practitioner to a specialist. Possible side effects
        include redness, darkening or lightening of the skin, and scarring. Total
        compliance during the treatment plan is required; this will include no
        sun bathing (or fake tanning) and cessation of all forms of hair removal,
        with the exception of shaving. </li>

</ul>
</p>

<h3>2.Medical treatments</h3>
<p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Eflornithine cream.</b> This cream works by slowing hair growth. It is not a
        depilatory cream. It has recently been accepted for use in women for
        whom other medical treatments cannot be used or have been
        ineffective. It can be applied after any regular hair removal techniques,
        such as the self-care or physical methods described in the preceding
        paragraphs. It is left on the skin to inhibit hair growth. The cream takes
        two to three months of regular use to have an effect. Continued
        treatment is needed to maintain beneficial effects. Side effects are
        usually mild and include burning or stinging of the skin and acne. </li>
    <li><b>Anti-androgens.</b>Your doctor may prescribe these to block the action of
        the androgens that can cause hirsutism. Anti-androgens usually take 4-
        6 months to have an effect. Hair growth will then slow, and the hairs
        will gradually become thinner and less noticeable; the problem,
        however, tends to return when medication is stopped. </li>

</ul>
</p>

<h3>3.Anti-androgens include:</h3>
<p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Oral contraceptives.</b>Some low-dose combined pills may help, and one
        has been designed specifically to have an anti-androgenic activity. Side
        effects include spotting (bleeding between periods), tender breasts,
        nausea and headaches, especially in the first few months. The oral
        contraceptive pill is not suitable for everyone. </li>
    <li><b>Cyproterone</b>Combined with an oral contraceptive this can help
        women with hirsutism. Larger doses of cyproterone (i.e. 50 to 200 mg
        for 10 days each cycle) can be used for more severe hirsutism. Side
        effects include weight gain, depression, blood clotting in veins of legs
        and loss of libido. </li>
    <li><b>Spironolactone.</b>This is used more commonly in the USA than in the
        UK. It works as an anti-androgen but also increases the amount of
        urine that is passed - in other words it is also a water tablet (diuretic).
        Spironolactone (50 to 200 mg daily) can slowly reduce excessive hair
        growth. Side effects include tender breasts, irregular menstruation and
        liver damage.
    </li>
    <li><b>Finasteride</b>Used at the dose to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia
        (5mg), rather than male-pattern baldness (1mg). This drug blocks the
        enzyme that makes testosterone into the active androgen
        dihydrotestosterone. It appears to be as effective as spironolactone,
        but is not licensed for treating hirsutism in the UK. Its usage should be
        restricted to postmenopausal women.</li>
</ul>

     <h2>Self-care (What can I do?)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

    <ul>
    <li><b>Shaving.</b>Some people think that shaving encourages more hair
        growth, but this is not true. However, the stubble that follows regrowth
        may be undesirable. Frequent shaving can irritate your skin. </li>
    <li><b>Waxing i</b>is effective for some people, but can irritate the skin and should
        be used with caution on the face. Scarring occasionally follows.
        Folliculitis (inflammation of the hair follicles) can occur with shaving,
        and waxing. </li>
    <li><b>Depilatories</b> (creams that remove hair) chemically dissolve hair shafts
        thereby leaving no stubble, but may also irritate your skin. Before using
        them you should first test your skin to see how sensitive it is. Always
        follow the manufacturer’s instructions for testing and product
        applications.</li>
    <li><b>Bleaching creams</b>are designed to make the dark hairs pale. They can
        irritate the skin and may be unsuitable for brown and black skins.</li>
