<h2>What is Hailey-Hailey disease?</h2>

<p>
    Hailey-Hailey disease is also known as familial benign chronic pemphigus. It is a rare inherited skin condition,
    in which red scaly areas or small blisters appear at sites of friction.
    The condition flares intermittently and tends to come and go. Many patients are able to lead full and normal lives,
    with their condition being a nuisance rather than a serious problem. Some patients are more severely affected and
    experience more persistent painful raw areas of the skin with development of superficial blisters.Hailey-Hailey
    disease is also known as familial benign chronic pemphigus. <br><br>
    It is a rare inherited skin condition in which red
    scaly areas that can be itchy and sore can lead to superficial blisters and eroded (broken) areas of the skin
    folds of the groin, armpits, neck and under the breasts. The condition flares intermittently and tends to come
    and go. Many patients are able to lead full and normal lives, with their condition being a nuisance rather
    than a serious problem. Some patients are more severely affected and experience more persistent painful
    raw areas of the skin with development of superficial blisters.

     <h2>What causes Hailey-Hailey disease?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    A small error in the DNA code for a gene on chromosome number 3 (one of the 46 chromosomes that we all have) has
    been shown to cause Hailey-Hailey disease. Normally this gene plays a part in ensuring that the cells in the
    outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) stick together properly. <br><br>
    In Hailey-Hailey disease, this adhesion of
    cells is impaired, resulting in separation of the cells in the epidermis, especially in areas of skin prone
    to friction such as the groin and under the arms. The altered gene runs in families and affects both men and
    women. Hailey-Hailey disease is not contagious, or a result of allergies. There is a tendency for
    Hailey-Hailey disease to get worse with sweating and friction, as well as in hot weather.


<h3>Is Hailey-Hailey disease hereditary?</h3>
<p>
    Yes â€“ see above. The condition is inherited in a pattern known as 'dominant inheritance', which means that there
    is a 1 in 2 [50:50] chance that each child of an affected parent will inherit the skin problem.

     <h2>What are the symptoms of Hailey-Hailey disease?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Affected skin may become uncomfortable and itchy if the skin surfaces are continually rubbing against each other,
    such as in the groin when walking. Outbreaks tend to settle down in a few days with appropriate treatment (see below),
    and may improve without treatment. Very rarely, a severe flare-up in an area such as the groin, genital area or in the
    crease of the buttocks may make walking and working so uncomfortable that a patient might need a few days rest.

     <h2>What does Hailey-Hailey disease look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The first signs of the condition usually appear between the ages of 15 and 40 years, but it may begin outside this
    age range. The severity varies enormously and is unpredictable. Red, scaly areas or small blisters appear at
    areas of friction, especially at the sides of the neck or in the skin folds under the arms, the groin or under
    the breasts. The skin looks entirely normal inbetween active episodes, and does not scar. Many patients notice
    that their condition improves as they get older.

     <h2>How will Hailey-Hailey disease be diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    It is very common for the condition to be mistaken for eczema, contact dermatitis (due to an allergy), a sweat rash,
    a fungal infection or impetigo (a bacterial skin infection). If required, the diagnosis of Hailey-Hailey disease can
    be confirmed by examining a sample of the skin (a biopsy) under the microscope.


<h3>Can Hailey-Hailey disease be cured?</h3>
<p>
    No. The underlying genetic defect cannot be altered; however, treatment does help and long remissions are common.

     <h2>How can Hailey-Hailey disease be treated?</h2>

    <div class="container">


    <ul>
    <li><b>Corticosteroid anti-inflammatory creams</b>can be very helpful and may be prescribed in combination with an antibiotic
        cream to treat skin infection. A pricking or itching sensation is usually present when a flare up is starting and the
        corticosteroid cream may prevent the rash from developing any further if the cream is applied immediately. Enough of the
        cream should be applied to the cover the affected area. The cream only needs to be used once or twice a day on the affected skin.
        There is no need to put the steroid cream on unaffected skin.</li>
    <li><b>Careful washing</b>is important with an antiseptic soap substitute or antiseptic bath oil to prevent infection occurring.</li>
    <li><b>Oral antibiotics.</b>There is an increased chance of developing a skin infection if you have Hailey-Hailey disease.
        Infection with germs such as Staphylococcus aureus may occur and require treatment with oral antibiotics prescribed by your doctor.
        The "cold sore" virus (herpes simplex) sometimes causes skin infection in patients with Hailey-Hailey disease. If the condition
        suddenly gets worse and is much more painful than usual this may be a sign of a cold sore virus infection. You should
        contact your GP or dermatologist immediately if this happens, as you may need oral anti-viral treatment.</li>
    <li><b>Tacrolimus ointment</b>has been found useful in some patients, although this preparation does not have a product licence to
        treat Hailey-Hailey disease.</li>
    <li><b>Sometimes oral (taken by mouth) treatments</b>that affect the immune system may need to be used (e.g. oral corticosteroids,
        ciclosporin, dapsone or methotrexate. These drugs have potentially serious side effects and are only prescribed for patients
        who do not respond to first line topical treatment or oral antibiotic treatment.</li>
    <li><b>Topical photodynamic therapy,</b>a type of light treatment, has been reported to help in some resistant cases.
        This involves application of a cream to the affected skin that sensitises the skin cells to light, followed by
        exposure to a special red lamp 3 hours later. The treatment can be painful.</li>
    <li><b>The use of botulinum toxin (to reduce sweating)</b>the removal of affected areas surgically (which may result in scar formation), and laser treatment.
