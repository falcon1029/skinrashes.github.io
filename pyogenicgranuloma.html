        <h2>What is Pyogenic Granuloma?</h2>

<p>
Pyogenic granulomas are skin growths that are small, round, and usually bloody-red 
in color. They tend to bleed because they contain a large number of blood vessels.
 They’re also known as lobular capillary hemangioma or granuloma telangiectaticum.
<br><br>
These skin growths mainly affect children and young adults, although they can 
develop in people of all ages. They are also fairly common in pregnant women. 
The hormone changes that occur during pregnancy can cause these growths to develop.
<br><br>
A pyogenic granuloma starts off as a lesion with a rapid growth period that usually 
lasts a few weeks. It then stabilizes into a raised, reddish nodule that’s typically 
smaller than 2 centimeters. The lesion can appear smooth, or it might have a crusty 
or rough surface, particularly if it bleeds a lot.
<br><br>
They’re benign (noncancerous) and can be safely removed through various methods.

     <h2>Where do pyogenic granulomas occur?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Pyogenic granulomas are commonly found on the:
<ul>
<li>hands</li>
<li>fingers</li>
<li>arms</li>
<li>face</li>
<li>neck</li>
<li>chest</li>
<li>back</li>
</ul>
They can also grow on the:
<ul>
<li>lips</li>
<li>eyelids</li>
<li>genitals</li>
<li>inside of the mouth</li>
</ul>
In rare cases, they can grow on the conjunctiva or cornea in your eye. The 
conjunctiva is the clear tissue over the white area of your eye. The cornea is 
the clear covering over your pupil and iris.
<br><br>
When they occur in pregnant women, they often grow on the gums and are called 
“pregnancy tumors.”

     <h2>What causes a pyogenic granuloma?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
It’s not always clear what causes a pyogenic granuloma. These growths can occur after 
injuries, but the reason for this isn’t known. Other causes of pyogenic granulomas 
include trauma caused by bug bites or by scratching your skin roughly or frequently. 
The hormone changes your body goes through when you’re pregnant can also cause pyogenic 
granulomas. Certain medications can also cause this condition. These include:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>indinavir (Crixivan)</li>
<li>isotretinoin (Accutane)</li>
<li>acitretin (Soriatane)</li>
<li>some birth control pills</li>
</ul>

     <h2>How serious is a pyogenic granuloma?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Pyogenic granulomas are always benign. Frequent bleeding is the most common 
type of complication.
<br><br>
However, pyogenic granulomas can also grow back after being removed. According 
to the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology (AOCD), pyogenic granulomas 
grow back in up to half of all cases, especially in young adults who have them 
in the upper back area. In rare cases, several lesions can appear in the area 
where the pyogenic granuloma was removed. If the granuloma isn’t removed completely, 
the remaining parts can spread to your blood vessels in the same area.

     <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Pyogenic granulomas occur in people of all races. Women are more frequently 
affected by pyogenic granulomas than men, though male and female children are 
equally affected.
<br><br>
Pyogenic granulomas are most often seen in:

 <ul>
<li>Children and young adults</li>
<li>Pregnant women</li>
<li>Women taking oral contraceptives</li>
<li>People taking certain oral retinoid medications, including isotretinoin
 or acitretin (Soriatane®)</li>
<li>People taking protease inhibitors such as indinavir (Crixivan®)</li>
<li>People on chemotherapy</li>
</ul>

     <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The most common locations for pyogenic granulomas include:

 <ul>
<li>Lips, gums, and inner mouth (particularly in pregnant women)</li>
<li>Hands and fingers</li>
<li>Head and neck</li>
<li>Feet and toes</li>
<li>Upper trunk</li>
</ul>
Typically, pyogenic granulomas appear as a beefy, red bump that enlarges 
rapidly over a few weeks. On average, pyogenic granulomas are about 5–10 mm 
in diameter. They may bleed easily and, in some cases, can be tender. Very rarely, 
more than one lesion of pyogenic granuloma may develop at the same time at the same site.

     <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
See your doctor if you notice any rapidly enlarging skin growth in order to 
establish a correct diagnosis. Because it is prone to easy bleeding, a pyogenic 
granuloma lesion should be covered with a bandage until you see your doctor.
</div>
</div>

     <h2>Pyogenic granuloma diagnosis</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Your doctor will likely be able to diagnose a pyogenic granuloma based on its 
appearance. Your doctor might do a biopsy, which involves taking a tissue sample, 
for a more accurate diagnosis. A biopsy also helps rule out malignant, or cancerous, 
medical conditions that can cause a similar kind of growth, such as squamous cell 
carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma.

     <h2>Pyogenic granuloma treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<p>
How a pyogenic granuloma is treated depends on its size and location:
</p>

<h3>Small pyogenic granulomas</h3>

<p>
You might not need treatment for small pyogenic granulomas. 
These often go away on their own.
</p>

<h3>Large pyogenic granulomas </h3>

<p>
If you have a bigger growth, your doctor will most likely shave it off and lightly 
cauterize or burn it. Cauterizing helps stop bleeding and can reduce the risk 
of it growing back.
<br><br>
According to the AOCD, the most effective way to remove pyogenic granulomas 
involves surgically removing the entire growth and using stitches to close the 
wound. This is a more invasive procedure than scraping one off. A pyogenic granuloma 
will usually be surgically removed if it has recurred once after a nonsurgical approach.
<br><br>
Alternatively, your doctor might apply a chemical, such as silver nitrate, to the 
pyogenic granuloma to help with the bleeding.
<br><br>
These growths can also be removed using laser surgery.
<br><br>
Don’t pick at the granulomas or try to remove them on your own. They tend to bleed for 
a long time, so having a doctor remove them with proper instruments and cautery tools is a must.
</p>


<h3>Pyogenic granulomas on the eye </h3>

<p>
Pyogenic granulomas that grow on your eye can be surgically removed or treated with 
ointments containing corticosteroids, which help reduce inflammation.
</p>


<h3>Pyogenic granulomas during pregnancy</h3>

<p>
If you’re pregnant, your doctor might recommend waiting to see if these growths 
disappear on their own after delivery. A decrease in hormone levels may help the 
lesion regress on its own. Ultimately, this approach is the safest for the growing fetus.
</p>


<h3>Developing treatments</h3>

<p>
Researchers are studying noninvasive treatments for pyogenic granulomas, particularly 
for children. Recent studies have found that a topical medication called timolol, 
applied as a gel to the nodule, is effective at treating the lesion without negative 
side effects.

     <h2>Long-term outlook</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Pyogenic granulomas are always benign, but it’s normal to be a little concerned, 
especially if the nodule is bleeding. They can also be a cosmetic concern for some 
people. You should talk to your doctor about any concerns you have. They can make 
sure the growth is benign and start discussing your treatment options with you.
<br><br>
While uncommon, some pyogenic granulomas may shrink and resolve on their own after 
time, particularly if the cause was related to pregnancy or a certain medication. 
In these cases, no removal procedure is necessary. However, most pyogenic granulomas
 will need some sort of procedure to treat and remove them.
