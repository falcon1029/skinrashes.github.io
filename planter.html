<h2>What are plantar warts?</h2>

<p>
    Warts are localised thickenings of the skin, and the term ‘plantar warts’ is used for those that occur
    on the soles of the feet (the ‘plantar’ surface). They are also known as verrucas.

     <h2>What causes plantar warts?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Warts are a form of infection with a virus called the ‘human papilloma virus’. There are many different strains of this virus,
    and plantar warts are usually due to just a few of these strains.  Infection of the cells of the outermost layer of the skin
    (the epidermis) with this virus results in this top layer of skin growing and thickening, creating the non-cancerous skin
    growth that is a wart.<br><br>

    Plantar warts are caught by contact with virally-infected skin scales: these are usually encountered on such surfaces as
    the floors of public locker rooms, shower cubicles and the tiled areas around swimming pools. However, the virus is not
    highly contagious, and it is unclear why some people catch plantar warts while others do not. The virus enters the skin
    through tiny breaks in the skin surface, and moistness and maceration of the skin on the feet probably make infection
    with the wart virus easier.


<h3>Are plantar warts hereditary?</h3>
<p>
    No.

     <h2>What are the symptoms of plantar warts?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Some plantar warts are uncomfortable, particularly if they are on a weight-bearing area when it may feel like having a
    stone in your shoe.  ‘Mosaic’ warts (see below) are usually painless.
<br><br>
    What do plantar warts look like?
<br><br>
    Plantar warts can occur anywhere on the soles and toes, and they often involve the weight-bearing areas. They vary in
    size from just a few millimetres to more than one centimetre. Each has a rough surface that protrudes slightly from the
    skin surface, surrounded by a horny collar. Close inspection of a plantar wart may reveal small black dots (which are
    blocked blood vessels).  An individual may have one or many verrucas, sometimes associated with warts elsewhere on the
    body. The term ‘mosaic wart’ is used when many small plantar warts pack together into a small area (resembling mosaic tiling).

     <h2>How will plantar warts be diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Usually this is easy, and based simply on the appearance. However, sometimes it may be hard to tell a plantar wart from a corn.
    One helpful point is that plantar warts interrupt the fine skin ridges on the sole, whereas corns do not. Your doctor may need
    to pare down the area to be certain of the diagnosis: he/she will be looking for the small black dots which confirm the
    diagnosis of a viral wart.  No other investigations are needed.

     <h2>Can plantar warts be cured?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Yes, but no single treatment can be guaranteed to be effective in every case.  The highest cure rates are in young people
    who have not had their warts for very long.  However, most verrucas will go away by themselves in due course, so it is
    very reasonable to leave them alone if they are not causing trouble.

     <h2>How can plantar warts be treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Most plantar warts can be managed with over-the counter topical treatments
    or by treatments prescribed by your general practitioner. Treatment options
    include:
<ul>
    <li><b>Salicylic acid paints and gels </b>are available in different strengths.
        Salicylic acid works by removing the outer dead layers of skin and
        triggering the immune system into clearing the virus. Before applying
        the paint, the feet should be soaked in warm water and thickened skin
        filed away with a pumice stone or emery board. Treatment should be
        daily for at least 12 weeks and is usually most convenient at bed-time.
        The paint /gel should be applied carefully to the wart, not the
        surrounding normal skin. If the wart becomes too sore, treatment
        should be stopped for a few days, then resumed. </li>
    <li><b>Cryotherapy. </b>(See patient information leaflet on Cryotherapy).
        Freezing the warts with liquid nitrogen (a very cold gas), may be
        available at your doctor’s surgery or podiatrist. Thick warts need to be
        shaved before freezing to allow the cold to get into the skin. Ideally,
        cryotherapy should be repeated every three to four weeks. It is painful
        and may cause blisters and burns, and because of this is not usually
        recommended in children. Several freezes may be needed to clear
        warts and it does not always work. Using a salicylic acid preparation in
        between freezes may improve the effectiveness. </li>
    <li><b>Other approved topical treatments </b>for plantar warts include
        formaldehyde gel, gultaraldehyde and silver nitrate caustic pencils.</li>
    <li><b>Other topical preparations</b> include dithranol podophyllotoxin, 5-
        fluorouracil, bleomycin and trichloroacetic acid.</li>
    <li><b>Contact immunotherapy</b> with a chemical paint such as
        diphenycyprone causes an allergic skin reaction that may boost the
        body’s immune reaction against the wart virus.</li>
    <li><b>Surgical removal </b>of warts is an option if topical treatments do not
        work. Options include tissue destructive laser therapy or curettage and
        cautery after a local anaesthetic injection into the skin. These
        procedures are painful and can lead to scarring. </li>
    <li><b>Photodynamic therapy and other lasers </b>(Pulsed Dye Laser and NdYAG)
        have also been used but are not widely available for treatment of
        warts.
    </li>
    <li><b>Complementary and alternative treatments </b>include hypnotherapy,
        homeopathy, acupuncture and herbal treatment.
    </li>
</ul>

     <h2>What can I do?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<ul>
    <li>Wear comfortable shoes and do not share your shoes or socks with
        anyone else. Special pads to relieve pressure on plantar warts can be
        bought at a chemist.</li>
    <li>Do not go barefoot in public places. Plantar warts should be covered
        with waterproof plasters or rubber ‘verruca socks’ if you go swimming. </li>
    <li>When treating the wart, dispose of any skin filings hygienically and do
        not use the emery board or hard skin removal tools elsewhere as this
        could spread the infection.</li>
    <li>Apply topical treatment regularly to get the maximum chance of cure.</li>
