        <h2>What is Basal Cell Carcinoma?</h2>
    A basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a type of skin cancer. There are two main types of skin cancer: melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer.
    BCC is a non-melanoma skin cancer, and is the most common type (> 80%) of all skin cancer (skin cancer incidence is < 1%) in the UK.
    BCC are sometimes referred to as ‘rodent ulcers’.

      <h2>What causes basal cell carcinoma?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The commonest cause is too much exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun or from sun beds.  Basal cell carcinomas can occur anywhere
    on your body, but are most common on areas that are exposed to the sun, such as your face, head, neck and ears.  It is also possible
    for a basal cell carcinoma to develop where burns, scars or ulcers have damaged the skin.  Basal cell carcinomas are not infectious.
    Basal cell carcinomas mainly affect fair skinned adults and are more common in men than women. Those with the highest risk of
    developing a basal cell carcinoma are:

<ul>
    <li>People with freckles or with pale skin and blond or red hair. </li>
    <li>Those who have had a lot of exposure to the sun, such as people with outdoor hobbies or who work out of doors, and people who have lived in sunny climates. </li>
    <li>People who use sun beds. </li>
    <li>People who have previously had a basal cell carcinoma. </li>
    <li>Are basal cell carcinomas hereditary? </li>
</ul>

Apart from a rare familial condition called Gorlin’s syndrome, basal cell carcinomas are not hereditary. However some of the things that
increase the risk of getting one (e.g. a fair skin, a tendency to burn rather than tan, and freckling) do run in families.

      <h2>What are the symptoms of basal cell carcinomas? </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Most basal cell carcinomas are painless. People often first become aware of them as a scab that bleeds occasionally and does not
heal completely. Some basal cell carcinomas are very superficial and look like a scaly red flat mark: others have a pearl-like rim
surrounding a central crater. If left for years, the latter type can eventually erode the skin causing an ulcer – hence the name
“rodent ulcer”. Other basal cell carcinomas are quite lumpy, with one or more shiny nodules crossed by small but easily seen blood vessels.

      <h2>How will my basal cell carcinoma be diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Sometimes the diagnosis is clear from its appearance. If further investigation is necessary a small area of the abnormal skin (a biopsy)
    or all of the lesion (an excision biopsy) may be cut out and examined under the microscope.  You will be given a local anaesthetic
    beforehand to numb the skin.

      <h2>Can basal cell carcinomas be cured?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Yes, basal cell carcinomas can be cured in almost every case, although treatment becomes complicated if they have been neglected for
    a very long time, or if they are in an awkward place - such as near the eye, nose or ear. Seldom, if ever, do they spread to other parts of the body.

      <h2>Basal Cell Carcinoma Treatment Options</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<h3>Surgery and related procedures</h3>

<p>
    Several surgical options are available for treating basal cell carcinoma. Depending on the size and location of the removed lesion,
    the wound may be allowed to heal on its own, stitched closed (sutured), or covered with a skin graft, a patch of healthy skin
    from another site on your body.
<br><br>
    These procedures include the following:

    <ul>
    <li><b>Electrodesiccation and curettage (ED&C). </b>ED&C is generally used to remove smaller or superficial basal cell carcinomas.
        The surgeon removes the surface of the skin
        cancer with a blade or scraping instrument (curette) and then sears the base of the cancer with an electric needle to control
        bleeding and kill cancer cells. In a similar procedure, the base is treated by freezing it with liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy)
        after curettage. ED&C can leave an oozing, crusty scab that usually heals within four to six weeks.</li>
    <li><b>Surgical excision. </b>In this procedure, your doctor cuts out the cancerous lesion and a surrounding margin of healthy skin.
        The margin is examined under a microscope to be sure there are no cancer cells. This procedure is used more often with larger lesions.</li>
    <li><b>Freezing. </b>This involves killing cancerous cells by freezing them with liquid nitrogen (cryosurgery). It's useful for cancers that
        are very thin and don't extend deep into the skin. This process requires a more prolonged freezing time — longer than cryotherapy with
        curettage — so it must be done carefully to avoid nerve damage that can result in a loss of feeling at the site.</li>
    <li><b>Mohs surgery. </b>During the procedure, your doctor removes the cancer cells layer by layer, examining each layer under
        the microscope until no abnormal cells remain. This allows the entire growth to be removed and only a very small amount
        of healthy tissue. This is usually an effective treatment for recurring basal cell carcinoma, a lesion on your face, and
        lesions that are large, deep, fast-growing or morpheaform. For aggressive cancers, this procedure may be followed by radiation therapy.</li>
   
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Drugs</h3>
<p>
    Drugs used to treat basal cell carcinoma include the following:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Topical treatments. </b>Basal cell carcinoma that is superficial and doesn't extend very far into the skin may be treated with
        creams or ointments. The drugs imiquimod (Aldara) and fluorouracil (Efudex, Fluoroplex, others) are used for several weeks to
        treat such low-risk basal cell carcinomas.</li>
    <li><b>Medication for advanced cancer. </b>Basal cell carcinoma that spreads to other areas of the body (metastasizes) may be treated
        with vismodegib (Erivedge) or sonidegib (Odomzo). These medications may also be an option for people whose cancers haven't
        responded to other treatments. These medications may block molecular signals that enable basal cell carcinomas to continue growing.</li>
