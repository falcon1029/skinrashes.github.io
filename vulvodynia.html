<h2>What are vulvodynia and vestibulodynia?</h2>

<p>
    Vulvodynia means ongoing pain in the vulva (the female genital area) when there is
    nothing abnormal to see and no known cause for the pain.
    <br><br>
    Vestibulodynia is a term used for pain arising at the entrance of the vagina, in the area
    known as the vestibule (the area of the openings to the vagina and the urethra), when
    any pressure, be it touch or friction, is applied. It is also called localised vulvodynia.
    <br><br>
    Vulvodynia, whether it is generalised or localised, may be described as provoked
    (caused by touch) or spontaneous (occurring without touch as a trigger).
    <br><br>
    Many conditions affecting the vulva can be painful (e.g. infections such as thrush or
    herpes, as well as skin diseases such as eczema). In vulvodynia, pain is felt in the
    vulva when there is no obvious visible cause for it and other diagnoses have been
    ruled out by examination and investigation.

    <h2>What causes vulvodynia?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

<p>
    The precise cause is unknown. The nerve endings in the skin of the vulva appear to
    become over-sensitive and send abnormal signals which are felt as a sensation of
    pain. Stress can make it worse. It is thought to affect about 15 in 100 women. It is not
    contagious or related to hygiene or hygiene products. Vulvodynia is one type of
    ‘complex regional pain syndrome’, others including migraine and fibromyalgia.
    It may be primary (with no known cause) or secondary (following another condition,
    usually one in which there is inflammation in the vulva, such as that from thrush).
</p>

<h3>Is vulvodynia hereditary?</h3>
<p>
    No.

    <h2>What are the symptoms of vulvodynia?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Pain occurs in the vulva, and occasionally involves the buttocks or even the inner
    thighs. It is often felt as a burning, stinging or raw discomfort and may be constant or
    intermittent. Symptoms may occur only in a small area or involve the entire vulva. The
    pain can occur spontaneously or when the vulva is touched. The ongoing pain can
    cause significant distress and anxiety as well as affecting sexual relationships.

<h3>What does vulvodynia look like?</h3>
<p>
    The skin of the vulva looks normal. This is important as other skin problems, such as
    infections, can cause the vulva to look abnormal (i.e. inflamed, very red, etc) as well
    as feel sore.

    <h2>How will vulvodynia be diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Your doctor will make the diagnosis by listening to your description of the problem and
    then examining you to exclude other causes of pain in the area. Gentle touch with a
    cotton bud near the entrance to the vagina can trigger discomfort in this condition.
    Taking swabs to look for infection or a biopsy (removal of a small sample of skin under
    a local anaesthetic to examine under the microscope) may occasionally be needed to
    rule out other causes, but there is no specific test to make the diagnosis.


<h3>Can vulvodynia be cured?</h3>
<p>
    There is no simple cure, but most patients will be helped by one or more of a variety
    of treatments, to the point at which it is no longer a problem.

    <h2>How can vulvodynia be prevented and treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Various treatments can be tried. Some of them may suit some women better than
    others, so it is worth trying different things to see which will help you. The following are
    sensible lines of treatment:

<br><br>
   <ul>
    <li>Avoid soap, bubble baths, shower gels, shampoos, special wipes and
        deodorants in this area. Wash with a soap substitute, as this will keep your skin
        soft and provide a barrier against irritation. Greasy ointments are a good soap
        substitute, and can be bought over the counter from chemists and at
        supermarkets without a prescription. Use petroleum jelly to protect the area
        from chlorine when you are swimming.</li>
    <li>A local anaesthetic ointment can be used to numb the area, reducing
        discomfort. Lidocaine cream and ointment can be bought without a prescription.
        This however should be purchased on doctor advice. It may sting a little when
        first applied, but this will settle. Those with mild symptoms can use it as and
        when it is required. Those with more severe symptoms can apply it more
        regularly. The ointment may also be applied 10 minutes before intercourse but
        must be wiped off fully if a condom is being used as it can interfere with its
        protective ability. Occasionally long term use of this ointment can cause allergy
        to lidocaine, but this is rare.
    </li>
</ul>
If these measures do not give you enough relief, then prescribed oral medication may
be needed. Three types are commonly used:

<ul>
    <li><b>Amitriptyline or Nortriptyline. </b>These medicines were developed as antidepressants
        but are now used for many pain problems (e.g. for migraine and
        post-shingles neuralgia). </li>
    <li><b>Gabapentin. </b>This is an anti-epileptic drug, which is also used for pain. </li>
    <li><b>Pregabalin. </b>This is a drug similar to Gabapentin.</li>
</ul>

Other treatments include:

<ul>
    <li><b>Pelvic floor exercise. </b>The pelvic floor is a group of muscles which are in the
        shape of a sling between the legs. These muscles keep the pelvic organs
        (bladder, uterus, and rectum) in place. Patients with vulvodynia who have sexrelated
        pain frequently have pelvic floor muscle dysfunction. Physiotherapy for
        the pelvic floor muscles can be helpful. </li>
    <li><b>Capsaicin cream </b>(related to chilli pepper) can help some women when applied
        to the vulval area.</li>
    <li><b>Intralesional injections. </b>Intralesional (into the vulva or the vestibule) injections
        (of steroid or local anaesthetic) may be considered in patients with vulvodynia
        triggered by touch. </li>
</ul>

    <h2>Self care (What can I do?)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    This condition is not life threatening or contagious. Follow the guidelines given above,
    and find what works best for you. Look at the stresses in your life (e.g. from your job,
    family, money, or partner) and try to reduce them as far as possible. High levels of
    stress will increase pain.
    <br><br>
    Avoid tight clothing in the genital area.
    <br><br>
    If intercourse is painful this may have emotional and psychological effects on sexual
    relationships. It is important to understand this, and to communicate fully with your
    partner, discovering techniques and lubricants that are comfortable and suit you both.
    <br><br>
    Psychosexual counselling from an expert may help.
    <br><br>
    Referral by your doctor to a ‘Pain management clinic’ may also be helpful.
    <br><br>
    Most women find that a combined approach including several approaches is the most
    effective way of managing vulvodynia.
