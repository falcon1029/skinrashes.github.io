        <h2>What is Discoid Lupus Erythematosus?</h2>


<p>
Lupus is a disease in which your body's self-protection mechanism (immune system) 
attacks your own body rather than a foreign invader. The cause of lupus is unknown, 
and the disease usually takes one of two forms: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 
which can affect any body organ; and discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), which is 
milder and usually affects only the skin. About 5%–10% of patients with discoid 
lupus erythematosus will progress to systemic lupus.
<br><br>
This condition causes a severe rash that tends to get worse when exposed to sunlight. 
The rash can appear anywhere on the body, but you’re likely to see it on the scalp, neck, 
hands, and feet. Severe cases can lead to permanent scarring, hyperpigmentation, 
and hair loss.

      <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Discoid lupus erythematosus most commonly afflicts young adult females, especially 
individuals of African and Hispanic descent, though it may occur at any age and it 
occurs worldwide. Lupus sometimes runs in families.

      <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Skin rash can range from a mild patch of pink to skin that looks red and raw. 
This can happen anywhere on your body, particularly the neck, palms, soles, and 
the area under your elbows. It can even affect the ear canal.

Symptoms include:
<ul>
<li>round lesions</li>
<li>thick scales on the skin and scalp</li>
<li>peeling</li>
<li>blistering lesions, especially around the elbows and fingertips</li>
<li>thinning of the skin</li>
<li>lighter or darker skin pigmentation, which can become permanent</li>
<li>thickening of the scalp</li>
<li>patches of hair loss, which can become permanent</li>
<li>brittle or bent fingernails</li>
<li>ulcers inside the lips</li>
<li>permanent scarring</li>
</ul>
Some people experience itching, though that’s usually not the case. Symptoms can flare 
up and then go into remission. Discoid lupus doesn’t affect overall health.

      <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<ul>
<li>Avoid sunlight exposure.</li>
<li>Sunscreens with UVB and UVA blockers (such as Parsol 1789, zinc, or 
titanium dioxide) are recommended.</li>
<li>Remember that clothing (dark colors and closely woven fabrics) and hats are 
very effective sun-blockers.</li>
<li>Excessive heat, excessive cold, and trauma to the affected regions may make 
the condition worse.</li>
<li>Use cosmetics (such as Covermark® or Dermablend™) to cover affected areas.</li>
</ul>

      <h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Because discoid lupus erythematosus can cause permanent scars and hair loss, 
you should seek medical care if you suspect you may have this condition.

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Your doctor will probably suspect discoid lupus upon clinical examination. But a 
skin biopsy is usually required for diagnosis. Starting treatment right away 
can help prevent permanent scarring.
<ol>
<li><b> Steroids</b>Steroids are used to help reduce inflammation. You can apply 
prescription-strength ointments or creams right to your skin. Or your doctor can 
administer a steroid injection directly into the affected area. Oral prednisone 
can help alleviate lesions by decreasing antibody production and inflammatory cells.
 Steroids can cause thinning of the skin, so they must be used sparingly and 
 with medical supervision.</li>
<li><b> Non-steroidal topical</b>Non-steroidal topical creams and ointments, 
such as calcineurin inhibitors like tacrolimus, can also help reduce inflammation.</li>
<li><b> Anti-malarial medications</b>Anti-malarial medications are another way to 
reduce inflammation. These oral drugs include hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and 
quinacrine. They tend to have milder side effects than some other drugs.</li>
<li><b> Immunosuppressive medications</b>Immunosuppressive medications may lower 
production of inflammatory cells. They’re usually used in severe cases or if you’re 
trying to wean off oral steroids. Some of these drugs are mycophenolate mofetil, 
azathioprine, and methotrexate.</li>
</ol>



<h3>Treatment tips</h3>
<p>
Other things you can do:
<ul>
<li>Avoid the sun. This can make it hard to get enough vitamin D, so ask your 
doctor if you should take vitamin D supplements.</li>
<li>Always use a sunscreen with an SPF of 70 or higher. Reapply every 
few hours or after getting wet.</li>
<li>Wear a hat and clothing that protects your skin, even on cloudy days.</li>
<li>Smoking can aggravate your condition. If you’re having trouble quitting, 
ask your doctor about smoking cessation programs.</li>
<li>Certain medications, such as antibiotics and diuretics can make you more 
sensitive to sunlight. Read medicine labels carefully and ask your doctor or 
pharmacist if your medication increases sensitivity to sunlight.</li>
<li>Depending on the condition of your skin, you may be able to wear camouflage 
makeup. But ask your doctor if that’s advisable and if there are particular 
ingredients you should avoid.</li>
</ul>

For scarring and pigment changes, filler, laser technology, and plastic surgery 
may be options. But this can only be determined on a case-by-case basis. If you’re 
interested, your dermatologist can offer personalized recommendations.

      <h2>What are the potential complications?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Repeated bouts of discoid lupus can leave you with scars or permanent discoloration. 
Patches on the scalp can cause your hair to fall out. As your scalp heals, 
scarring can prevent hair from growing back.
<br><br>
The risk of skin cancer may be increased if you have long-lasting lesions on 
your skin or inside your lips and mouth.
<br><br>
About five percent of people with discoid lupus will develop systemic lupus at 
some point. Systemic lupus can also affect your internal organs.
