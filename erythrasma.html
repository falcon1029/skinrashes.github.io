      <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
You’re more likely to develop erythrasma if you:

<ul>
<li>have diabetes</li>
<li>live in a warm or humid climate</li>
<li>sweat a lot</li>
<li>are obese</li>
<li>are older</li>
<li>have poor hygiene</li>
<li>have a medical condition that affects the immune system</li>
</ul>

Erythrasma is more common in hot and humid climates. It’s mostly seen 
in tropical and subtropical areas. It can affect people at any age,
 but it’s more common among older adults.

      <h2>What causes erythrasma?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Erythrasma is caused by the <b>Corynebacterium minutissimum bacteria</b>. 
The bacteria normally live on the skin and can grow in warm, moist areas. 
That’s why it’s commonly found in folds of the skin.

      <h2>How is erythrasma diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Your doctor will ask you about your medical history and do a physical 
exam to start the diagnosis process. Then, your doctor will do a Wood’s 
lamp skin examination. This lamp uses ultraviolet radiation to look at 
your skin. Under this lamp, erythrasma will have a red or coral color.
<br><br>
Your doctor may take a swab or skin scraping to examine the cultures 
more closely under a microscope.

      <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Erythrasma looks like a patch of pink to red, scaly skin. The border 
of erythrasma is well-defined, meaning there is a sharp border between 
the affected patch and the surrounding normal skin. Over time, the pink
 or red color fades to tan or brown.
<br><br>
Erythrasma is typically located in moist body folds such as:
<ul>
<li>Under the arms (axillae)</li>
<li>In the groin and inner thighs</li>
<li>Between the toes, especially between the 4th and 5th toes</li>
</ul>
Less commonly, erythrasma can be found in the buttock crevice or in 
the folds underneath the breasts. In certain individuals, especially 
in those with diabetes, the infection can become widespread and can 
involve the trunk, arms, and legs.
<br><br>
Erythrasma usually causes no symptoms, but some people report mild 
itching or burning, especially in the groin area.

      <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
If you suspect that you have erythrasma, try:

<ul>
<li>Gently scrubbing the involved area with antibacterial soap</li>
<li>Keeping the involved area dry</li>
<li>Applying over-the-counter creams containing tolnaftate or miconazole</li>
</ul>
</div>

      <h2>How is erythrasma treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Treatment will depend on the severity of your condition. Your doctor may 
recommend any of the following treatments:

<ul>
<li>oral antibiotics, such as erythromycin (Erythrocin Stearate)</li>
<li>cleaning the affected area with antibiotic soap</li>
<li>applying fusidic acid to the skin</li>
<li>antibacterial solutions or creams on your skin, such as clindamycin
 HCL solution, erythromycin cream, or miconazole cream (Lotrimin, Cruex)</li>
<li>red light therapy</li>
</ul>

Treatment may take two to four weeks to work. You may need to try a 
combination of treatments.
<br><br>
Topical creams and solutions are usually used first. Oral antibiotics are 
added if the first treatments don’t work. Sometimes a combination of oral 
and topical treatments is necessary. In some cases, treating the underlying 
disease, like diabetes, can also help.



<h3>What are the complications of erythrasma?</h3>

<p>
Complications are rare with erythrasma. In rare cases, erythrasma can 
become more serious. Septicemia, a serious blood infection, may develop.

      <h2>How is erythrasma prevented?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
There are several things you may be able to do to prevent erythrasma:

<ul>
<li>Keep your skin dry and clean.</li>
<li>Make sure you dry your skin completely after bathing.</li>
<li>Avoid excessive sweating, if possible.</li>
<li>Make sure your shoes are dry before wearing them.</li>
<li>Wear clean, dry clothes.</li>
<li>Try to avoid hot or humid areas.</li>
<li>Treat underlying medical conditions, like diabetes.</li>

      <h2>What’s the outlook?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Erythrasma can be treated. Most people respond to treatment
 within two to four weeks. However, it’s possible for erythrasma
 to become chronic and return. This is more likely to happen if 
 you have a medical condition that affects your immune system.
<br><br>
In general, erythrasma is a mild condition. It shouldn’t interfere 
with your ability to do normal activities.
