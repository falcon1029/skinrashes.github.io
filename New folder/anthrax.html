Anthrax is a disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, a bacterium 
that has the ability to form spores; spores are cells that are essentially 
dormant (asleep) but may become active under certain conditions. Anthrax 
disease can take 3 forms:
<ul>
    <li>Involving the skin (cutaneous) – 20% mortality</li>
    <li>Involving the lungs (inhalational) – 90% mortality</li>
	<li>Involving the digestive system (gastrointestinal) – 100% mortality</li>
	</ul>

The vast majority of cases of anthrax (95%) are cutaneous. As a naturally 
occurring disease, anthrax is very rare. However, it has the potential to be 
used as a weapon of bioterrorism; this occurred in 2001 with an attack on the 
United States via the US Postal service. Anthrax was mixed in powder that was 
put into letters and packages and sent to prominent US figures, including senators.
 A number of people contracted cutaneous or inhalational anthrax from exposure 
 to the powder, and some people died. If there were to be future attacks on 
 the US using anthrax, it would probably be disseminated as an aerosol, and 
 the resulting cases would be inhalational anthrax.

Anthrax is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by Bacillus anthracis 
that normally affects animals, especially ruminants (such as goats, cattle, 
sheep, and horses). Anthrax can be transmitted to humans by contact with infected 
animals or their products. In recent years, anthrax has received a great deal of
 attention as it has become clear that the infection can also be spread by a
 bioterrorist attack or by biological warfare. Anthrax does not spread from person 
 to person and is not considered contagious.
<br><br>
There have been a number of outbreaks over the years that are usually localized. 
Most recently in 2016, in Siberia, Russia, there was a major outbreak of anthrax 
that sickened at least 13 Siberian people and killed over 2,000 reindeer. 
Authorities believe that the melting permafrost unburied a reindeer that died 
of anthrax 75 years ago, causing the release of anthrax spores.

The agent of anthrax is a bacterium called Bacillus anthracis. While other investigators 
discovered the anthrax bacillus, it was a German physician and scientist, 
Dr. Robert Koch, who proved that the anthrax bacterium was the cause of a disease 
that affected farm animals in his community. Under the microscope, the bacteria 
look like large rods. However, in the soil, where they live, anthrax organisms 
exist in a dormant form called spores. These spores are very hardy and difficult 
to destroy. The spores have been known to survive in the soil for as long as 48 years.
 The bacteria secrete toxins composed of three proteins termed protective antigen, 
 lethal factor, and edema factor.

Anthrax can infect humans in three ways. The most common is infection through the skin, 
which causes an ugly, dark sore. Humans and animals can ingest anthrax from
 carcasses of dead animals that have been contaminated with anthrax. Ingestion
 of anthrax can cause serious, sometimes fatal disease. The most deadly form is 
 inhalation anthrax. If the spores of anthrax are inhaled, they migrate to lymph 
 glands in the chest where they proliferate, spread, and produce toxins that often 
 cause death.

B. anthracis is a very rare bacterium, and it causes disease infrequently. 
It is present naturally in both wild and domestic animals and in soil, particularly 
where an infected animal has died or been killed. People in contact with infected 
animals are at higher risk of contracting anthrax; these people include:

<ul>
    <li>Veterinarians</li>
    <li>Meat processors</li>
	<li>Animal shearers</li>
	<li>Tanners</li>
</ul>
In the case of a bioterrorism attack, anyone exposed to B. anthracis is 
at risk of contracting anthrax. Other people at high risk include:
<ul>
    <li>Postal workers</li>
    <li>Lab workers in facilities with B. anthracis</li>

 <ul>
   <li><b>Cutaneous anthrax</b>The cutaneous (skin) form of anthrax (80% of all 
   anthrax infections) starts as a red-brown raised spot that enlarges with considerable 
   redness around it, blistering, and hardening. The center of the spot then shows an 
   ulcer crater with blood-tinged drainage and the formation of a black crust called an 
   eschar. There are swollen glands (lymph nodes) in the area. Symptoms include muscle 
   aches and pain, headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting. The illness usually resolves 
   in about six weeks, but deaths may occur if patients do not receive appropriate antibiotics.</li>
   
   <li><b>Injection anthrax</b>This new form of anthrax has been identified in heroin-injecting 
   drug users in northern Europe and has not yet been reported in the United States. 
   Symptoms may take days to months before they appear. The signs and symptoms of 
   injection anthrax can include small blisters or bumps that may itch at the injection 
   site, fever and chills, swelling around the sores, and deep abscesses may develop 
   under the skin or muscle. Painless skin sores with black centers (dark scabs) may 
   appear after the blisters or bumps develop.</li>
   
   <li><b>Inhalation anthrax</b>The first symptoms are subtle, gradual and flu-like (influenza) 
   with a sore throat and headaches. In a few days, however, the illness worsens and 
   there may be severe respiratory distress with shortness of breath and pain in the 
   chest and/or muscles. Some patients may begin coughing up blood. Shock, coma, and 
   death follow. Inhalation anthrax does not cause a true pneumonia. In fact, the spores 
   get picked in the lungs up by scavenger cells called macrophages. Most of the spores 
   are killed. Unfortunately, some survive and are transported to glands in the chest 
   called lymph nodes. Lymph nodes may swell. In the lymph nodes, the spores that survive
   multiply, produce deadly toxins, and spread throughout the body. Severe hemorrhage 
   and tissue death (necrosis) occurs in these lymph nodes in the chest. From there, the
   disease spreads to the adjacent lungs and the rest of the body. Inhalation anthrax 
   is a very serious disease, and unfortunately, most affected individuals will die even
   if they get appropriate antibiotics. Why is this so? The antibiotics are effective 
   in killing the bacteria, but they do not destroy the deadly toxins that have already
   been released by the anthrax bacteria.</li>
   
   <li><b>Gastrointestinal anthrax</b>Now rare, anthrax of the bowels (gastrointestinal anthrax)
   is the result of eating undercooked, contaminated meat. The symptoms of this form of anthrax 
   include nausea, loss of appetite, bloody diarrhea and fever followed by abdominal pain. 
   The bacteria invade through the bowel wall. Then the infection spreads throughout the body 
   through the bloodstream (septicemia) with deadly toxicity.</li>

<ul>
    <li>Characteristic rash</li>
   
	</ul>
*The characteristic rash of anthrax looks like pink, itchy bumps that occur 
at the site where B. anthracis comes into contact with scratched or otherwise 
open skin. The pink bumps progress to blisters, which further progress to open 
sores with a black base (called an eschar). The early rash (the pink, itchy bumps) 
looks like many other rashes, so a history of exposure to the bacterium will be 
important to making the diagnosis. The eschar is more characteristic of anthrax 
infection, but if diagnosis and treatment are delayed until the eschar appears,
 the prognosis is poor.

In most cases, early treatment can cure anthrax. The cutaneous (skin) form of 
anthrax can be treated with common antibiotics such as penicillin, tetracycline, 
erythromycin (Ilotycin, Ery-Ped, Ery-Tab), and ciprofloxacin (Cipro). 
The pulmonary form of anthrax is a medical emergency. Early and continuous 
intravenous therapy with antibiotics may be lifesaving. In a bioterrorism attack, 
individuals exposed to anthrax will be given antibiotics before they become sick.
 A vaccine exists but is not yet available to the general public. Most experts 
 think that the vaccine will also be given to exposed individuals who are victims 
 of a bioterrorist attack. Of note, anthrax is a reportable disease. That means 
 that local or state health agencies must be notified if a case of anthrax is 
 diagnosed. These agencies can better characterize the anthrax so that the 
 affected individual can receive the most effective treatment for that particular organism.
<br><br>
Individuals exposed to aerosolized spores (bioterrorism scares or attacks, for 
example) can participate in postexposure prevention of anthrax. Four antibiotics 
are recommended by the FDA: doxycycline (Doryx, Oracea, Monodox), ciprofloxacin, 
levofloxacin (Levaquin, Quixin, Iquix), and parenteral procaine penicillin G. In 
addition to these antibiotics, a three-dose series of anthrax vaccine should be 
started as soon as possible after exposure.
