  Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease affecting 2% of the population. It occurs equally in men and women,
    can appear at any age, and tends to come and go unpredictably. It is not infectious, therefore you cannot catch
    psoriasis from someone else. It does not scar the skin although sometimes it can cause a temporary increase or
    reduction in skin pigmentation. Although psoriasis is a long-term condition there are many effective treatments
    available to keep it under good control. Psoriasis can affect the nails and the joints as well as the skin.
    About half of people with psoriasis have psoriasis affecting the nails.<br><br>

    For people with moderate to severe psoriasis about one in three will develop psoriatic arthritis at some time.
    Psoriatic arthritis produces swelling and stiffness in the joints or stiffness in the lower back and should be
    managed by a rheumatologist who works closely with your dermatologist and/or your GP.<br><br>

    Psoriasis, particularly moderate to severe psoriasis, is associated with an increased risk of anxiety and depression.
    Moderate to severe psoriasis increases the risk of heart disease and stroke and treatment of psoriasis may reduce this risk.
    Psoriasis can also be associated with an increased risk of harmful use of alcohol and with diabetes and obesity.

 Both inherited and environmental factors play a role in the development of psoriasis. Some people are more likely to
    develop psoriasis than others, particularly if someone in their family has psoriasis. Skin affected by psoriasis is
    red and scaly. The outer layer of skin (the epidermis) contains skin cells which are continuously being replaced.
    This process normally takes between three and four weeks. In psoriasis, the rate of turnover is dramatically
    increased so that cells are formed and shed in as little as three or four days. For many individuals factors
    such infections, stress, alcohol and/or smoking have a role triggering flares of psoriasis. Certain medications
    such as beta blockers (used to treat high blood pressure and angina), lithium and tablets used to treat malaria,
    can also cause psoriasis to flare. The relationship between diet and psoriasis has not been fully established,
    but obesity is associated with psoriasis and exercise and losing weight can be beneficial.

<h3>Is psoriasis hereditary?</h3>
<p>
    Yes, but the way it is inherited is complex.

The skin changes of psoriasis (often known as plaques) are pink or red areas with silvery-white scales.
    Many people have just a few plaques but individuals with moderate to severe psoriasis may have several
    plaques covering large areas of their body.<br><br>

    Four patterns of psoriasis are recognised:<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis. Plaques of psoriasis are usually present on the knees,
        elbows, trunk and scalp, although others areas can be involved too.</li>
    <li>Guttate psoriasis consists of small plaques of psoriasis scattered over the trunk and limbs. It can be precipitated by
    a bacteria called Streptococcus which can cause throat infections.</li>
    <li>Palmoplantar psoriasis is psoriasis affecting the hands and feet. Psoriasis may appear at other sites too.</li>
    <li>Pustular psoriasis is rare type of psoriasis where the plaques on the trunk and limbs are studded with tiny pus spots.</li>
    It can be localised or generalised and can flare rapidly necessitating hospital admission for treatment. Nail psoriasis is
    present in about half of people with psoriasis. The features of nail psoriasis are:
    <li>Pitting (indentations) of the surface of the nail.</li>
    <li>Salmon pink areas of discolouration under the nail.</li>
    <li>Separation of the nail plate from the nail bed.</li>
    <li>Thickening of the nails.</li>

        symptoms or ask you to complete a screening questionnaire.</li>

    Psoriasis may be assessed using a variety of tools:
    <ul>
    <li>Physician global assessment (PGA): this ranges from mild to very severe and is a physician’s overall impression of the
        severity of the psoriasis.</li>
    <li>Patient global assessment: this is the same as the physician global assessment but is the overall impression of the severity
        of psoriasis provided by the person with psoriasis.</li>
    <li>PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) is calculated by looking at four areas: the head and neck, upper limbs, lower limbs
        and the trunk. In each of these areas the redness, scaliness, thickness and surface area affected are assessed and used to
        calculate the PASI score. This score ranges from 0–72 with 0 being no psoriasis and 72 being severe. In practice any score
        above 10 indicates severe psoriasis.</li>
    <li>DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) is a series of 10 questions which asks how psoriasis has impacted on your life in the
        past 7 days. The score ranges from 0–30 with 0 indicating no impact and a score above 10 indicating a considerable impact
        on quality of life. DLQI does not assess distress.</li>
    <li>PEST score (Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool) is used to screen for possible psoriatic arthritis.</li>
    <li>HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) or other scales may be used to screen for depression and/or anxiety.</li>

</ul>
Blood tests may be recommended by your GP or dermatologist. If you are considering tablet treatment for your psoriasis then blood
tests will be needed before and during treatment.

    Psoriasis treatments reduce inflammation and clear the skin. Treatments can be divided into three main types:
    topical treatments, light therapy and systemic medications.
</p>
<h3>1.Topical treatments</h3>
<p>
    Used alone, creams and ointments that you apply to your skin can effectively treat mild to moderate psoriasis.
    When the disease is more severe, creams are likely to be combined with oral medications or light therapy.
    Topical psoriasis treatments include:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Topical corticosteroids. </b>These drugs are the most frequently prescribed medications for treating
        mild to moderate psoriasis.
        They reduce inflammation and relieve itching and may be used with other treatments.
        Mild corticosteroid ointments are usually recommended for sensitive areas, such as your face or skin
        folds, and for treating widespread patches of damaged skin.
        Your doctor may prescribe stronger corticosteroid ointment for smaller, less sensitive or tougher-to-treat areas.
        Long-term use or overuse of strong corticosteroids can cause thinning of the skin. Topical corticosteroids
        may stop working over time. It's usually best to use topical corticosteroids as a short-term treatment during flares.</li>
    <li><b>Vitamin D analogues. </b>These synthetic forms of vitamin D slow skin cell growth. Calcipotriene
        (Dovonex) is a prescription cream or solution containing a vitamin D analogue that treats mild to
        moderate psoriasis along with other treatments. Calcipotriene might irritate your skin. Calcitriol
        (Vectical) is expensive but may be equally effective and possibly less irritating than calcipotriene.</li>
    <li><b>Anthralin. </b>This medication helps slow skin cell growth. Anthralin (Dritho-Scalp) can also remove
        scales and make skin smoother. But anthralin can irritate skin, and it stains almost anything it touches.
        It's usually applied for a short time and then washed off.</li>
    <li><b>Topical retinoids. </b>These are vitamin A derivatives that may decrease inflammation. The most common
        side effect is skin irritation. These medications may also increase sensitivity to sunlight, so while using
        the medication apply sunscreen before going outdoors.
        The risk of birth defects is far lower for topical retinoids than for oral retinoids. But tazarotene
        (Tazorac, Avage) isn't recommended when you're pregnant or breast-feeding or if you intend to become pregnant.</li>
    <li><b>Calcineurin inhibitors. </b>Calcineurin inhibitors — tacrolimus (Prograf) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) —
        reduce inflammation and plaque buildup.
        Calcineurin inhibitors are not recommended for long-term or continuous use because of a potential increased
        risk of skin cancer and lymphoma. They may be especially helpful in areas of thin skin, such as around
        the eyes, where steroid creams or retinoids are too irritating or may cause harmful effects.</li>
    <li><b>Salicylic acid. </b>Available over-the-counter (nonprescription) and by prescription, salicylic acid promotes
        sloughing of dead skin cells and reduces scaling. Sometimes it's combined with other medications, such as topical
        corticosteroids or coal tar, to increase its effectiveness. Salicylic acid is available in medicated shampoos and
        scalp solutions to treat scalp psoriasis</li>
    <li><b>Coal tar. </b>Derived from coal, coal tar reduces scaling, itching and inflammation. Coal tar can irritate
        the skin. It's also messy, stains clothing and bedding, and has a strong odor.
        Coal tar is available in over-the-counter shampoos, creams and oils. It's also available in higher concentrations
        by prescription. This treatment isn't recommended for women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.</li>
    <li><b>Moisturizers. </b>Moisturizing creams alone won't heal psoriasis, but they can reduce itching, scaling and dryness.
        Moisturizers in an ointment base are usually more effective than are lighter creams and lotions.
        Apply immediately after a bath or shower to lock in moisture.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<h3>2.Light therapy (phototherapy)</h3>
<p>
    This treatment uses natural or artificial ultraviolet light. The simplest and easiest form of phototherapy
    involves exposing your skin to controlled amounts of natural sunlight.
</p><p>
    Other forms of light therapy include the use of artificial ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light,
    either alone or in combination with medications.
<ul>
    <li><b>Sunlight. </b>Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays in sunlight or artificial light slows skin cell
        turnover and reduces scaling and inflammation. Brief, daily exposures to small amounts of sunlight
        may improve psoriasis, but intense sun exposure can worsen symptoms and cause skin damage. Before
        beginning a sunlight regimen, ask your doctor about the safest way to use natural sunlight for psoriasis treatment.</li>
    <li><b>UVB phototherapy. </b>Controlled doses of UVB light from an artificial light source may improve
        mild to moderate psoriasis symptoms. UVB phototherapy, also called broadband UVB, can be used to treat
        single patches, widespread psoriasis and psoriasis that resists topical treatments. Short-term side
        effects may include redness, itching and dry skin. Using a moisturizer may help decrease these side effects.</li>
    <li><b>Narrow band UVB phototherapy. </b>A newer type of psoriasis treatment, narrow band UVB phototherapy
        may be more effective than broadband UVB treatment. It's usually administered two or three times a
        week until the skin improves, and then maintenance may require only weekly sessions. Narrow band
        UVB phototherapy may cause more-severe and longer lasting burns, however.</li>
    <li><b>Goeckerman therapy. </b>Some doctors combine UVB treatment and coal tar treatment, which is
        known as Goeckerman treatment. The two therapies together are more effective than either alone
        because coal tar makes skin more receptive to UVB light.</li>
    <li><b>Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). </b>This form of photochemotherapy involves taking a
        light-sensitizing medication (psoralen) before exposure to UVA light. UVA light penetrates
        deeper into the skin than does UVB light, and psoralen makes the skin more responsive to UVA exposure.

        This more aggressive treatment consistently improves skin and is often used for more-severe cases of
        psoriasis. Short-term side effects include nausea, headache, burning and itching. Long-term side effects
        include dry and wrinkled skin, freckles, increased sun sensitivity, and increased risk of skin cancer, including melanoma.</li>
    <li><b>Excimer laser. </b>This form of light therapy, used for mild to moderate psoriasis, treats only the
        involved skin without harming healthy skin. A controlled beam of UVB light is directed to the psoriasis plaques
        to control scaling and inflammation. Excimer laser therapy requires fewer sessions than does traditional
        phototherapy because more powerful UVB light is used. Side effects can include redness and blistering.</li>


</ul>
</p>

<h3>3.Oral or injected medications</h3>
<p>
    If you have severe psoriasis or it's resistant to other types of treatment, your doctor may prescribe oral or
    injected drugs. This is known as systemic treatment. Because of severe side effects, some of these medications
    are used for only brief periods and may be alternated with other forms of treatment.
<ul>
    <li><b>Retinoids.</b>Related to vitamin A, this group of drugs may help if you have severe psoriasis that doesn't
        respond to other therapies. Side effects may include lip inflammation and hair loss. And because retinoids such as
        acitretin (Soriatane) can cause severe birth defects, women must avoid pregnancy for at least three years after
        taking the medication.</li>
    <li><b>Methotrexate. </b>Taken orally, methotrexate (Rheumatrex) helps psoriasis by decreasing the production of
        skin cells and suppressing inflammation. It may also slow the progression of psoriatic arthritis in some people.
        Methotrexate is generally well-tolerated in low doses but may cause upset stomach, loss of appetite and fatigue.
        When used for long periods, it can cause a number of serious side effects, including severe liver damage and
        decreased production of red and white blood cells and platelets.</li>
    <li><b>Cyclosporine. </b>Cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral) suppresses the immune system and is similar to methotrexate
        in effectiveness, but can only be taken short-term. Like other immunosuppressant drugs, cyclosporine increases
        your risk of infection and other health problems, including cancer. Cyclosporine also makes you more susceptible
        to kidney problems and high blood pressure — the risk increases with higher dosages and long-term therapy.</li>
    <li><b>Drugs that alter the immune system (biologics). </b>Several of these drugs are approved for the treatment
        of moderate to severe psoriasis. They include etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira),
        ustekinumab (Stelara), golimumab (Simponi), apremilast (Otezla), secukinumab (Cosentyx) and ixekizumab (Taltz).
        Most of these drugs are given by injection (apremilast is oral) and are usually used for people who have failed
        to respond to traditional therapy or who have associated psoriatic arthritis. Biologics must be used with
        caution because they have strong effects on the immune system and may permit life-threatening infections.
        In particular, people taking these treatments must be screened for tuberculosis.</li>
    <li><b>Other medications. </b>Thioguanine (Tabloid) and hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea) are medications that can be used when other drugs can't be given.</li>
</ul>

 A number of alternative therapies claim to ease the symptoms of psoriasis, including special diets, creams,
    dietary supplements and herbs. None have definitively been proved effective. But some alternative therapies
    are deemed generally safe, and they may be helpful to some people in reducing signs and symptoms, such as
    itching and scaling. These treatments would be most appropriate for those with milder, plaque disease
    and not for those with pustules, erythroderma or arthritis.
    <ul>
    <li><b>Aloe vera.</b>Taken from the leaves of the aloe vera plant, aloe extract cream may reduce redness,
        scaling, itching and inflammation. You may need to use the cream several times a day for a month or
        more to see any improvements in your skin. </li>
    <li><b>Fish oil. </b>Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil supplements may reduce inflammation associated
        with psoriasis, although results from studies are mixed. Taking 3 grams or less of fish oil daily is
        generally recognized as safe, and you may find it beneficial.</li>
    <li><b>Oregon grape. </b>Also known as barberry, topical applications of Oregon grape may reduce
        inflammation and ease psoriasis symptoms.</li>
