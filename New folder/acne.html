    Acne is a very common skin condition characterised by comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) and pus-filled spots (pustules).
    It usually starts at puberty and varies in severity from a few spots on the face, back and chest, which most adolescents will have at some time,
    to a more serious problem that may be embarrassing, sap self-confidence and cause scarring. For the majority it tends to resolve by the late teens
    or early twenties but can persist for longer in some people. Acne can develop for the first time in people in their late twenties or even the thirties.
    It occasionally occurs in young children.

    The sebaceous (oil-producing) glands of people who get acne are particularly sensitive to normal blood levels of a hormone called
    testosterone, which is present in both men and women. This causes the glands to produce an excess of oil. At the same time,
    the dead skin cells lining the pores are not shed properly and clog up the follicles. These two effects result in a build-up
    of oil producing blackheads (where a darkened plug of oil is visible) and whiteheads.
    <br><br>

    The acne bacterium (known as Propionibacterium acnes) lives on everyone’s skin, usually causing no problems, but,
    in those prone to acne, the build up of oil creates an ideal environment in which these bacteria can multiply.
    This triggers inflammation and the formation of red or pus-filled spots.

    and scars. Occasionally, large, tender spots or cysts may develop which can either eventually burst and discharge their contents or may heal up without bursting.

    Acne is easily recognised by the appearance of the spots and by their distribution on the face, neck, chest or back.
    However there are several varieties of acne and your doctor will be able to tell you which type you have after examining your skin.
    The most common type is “acne vulgaris”.

    <div class="container">
<h3>1.Benzoyl peroxide</h3>
<p>
    Benzoyl peroxide works as an antiseptic to reduce the number of bacteria on the surface of the skin.
    It also helps to reduce the number of whiteheads and blackheads, and has an anti-inflammatory effect.
    <br><br>
    Benzoyl peroxide is usually available as a cream or gel. It's used either once or twice a day.
    It should be applied 20 minutes after washing to all of the parts of your face affected by acne.
    <br><br>
    It should be used sparingly, as too much can irritate your skin. It also makes your face more sensitive
    to sunlight, so avoid too much sun and ultraviolet (UV) light, or wear sun cream.
    <br><br>
    Benzoyl peroxide can have a bleaching effect, so avoid getting it on your hair or clothes.
    <br><br>
    Common side effects of benzoyl peroxide include:
    <ul>
    <li>dry and tense skin</li>
    <li>a burning, itching or stinging sensation</li>
    <li>some redness and peeling of the skin</li>
    <li>Side effects are usually mild and should pass once the treatment has finished.</li>
    <li> Most people need a six-week course of treatment to clear most or all of their acne. You may be advised
        to continue treatment less frequently to prevent acne returning.</li>

</ul>
</p>


<h3>2.Topical retinoids</h3>
<p>
    Topical retinoids work by removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin (exfoliating)
    which helps to prevent them building up within hair follicles.
    <br><br>
    Tretinoin and adapalene are topical retinoids used to treat acne. They're available in a gel
    or cream and are usually applied once a day before you go to bed.
    <br><br>
    Apply to all the parts of your face affected by acne 20 minutes after washing your face.
    <br><br>
    It's important to apply topical retinoids sparingly and avoid excessive exposure to sunlight and UV.
   <br><br>
    Topical retinoids aren't suitable for use during pregnancy, as there's a risk they might cause birth defects.
    <br><br>
    The most common side effects of topical retinoids are mild irritation and stinging of the skin.
    <br><br>
    A six-week course is usually required, but you may be advised to continue using the medication less frequently after this.
</p>


<h3>3.Topical antibiotics</h3>
<p>
    Topical antibiotics help kill the bacteria on the skin that can infect plugged hair follicles.
    They're available as a lotion or gel that is applied once or twice a day.
    <br><br>
    A six- to eight-week course is usually recommended. After this, treatment is usually stopped,
    as there's a risk that the bacteria on your face could become resistant to the antibiotics.
    This could make your acne worse and cause additional infections.
    <br><br>
    Side effects are uncommon, but can include:

    <ul>
    <li>minor irritation of the skin</li>
    <li>redness and burning of the skin</li>
    <li>peeling of the skin</li>
</ul>

</p>



<h3>4.Azelaic acid</h3>
<p>
    Azelaic acid is often used as an alternative treatment for acne if the side effects of benzoyl
    peroxide or topical retinoids are particularly irritating or painful.
    <br><br>
    Azelaic acid works by getting rid of dead skin and killing bacteria. It's available as a cream
    or gel and is usually applied twice a day (or once a day if your skin is particularly sensitive).
    <br><br>
    The medication doesn't make your skin sensitive to sunlight, so you don't have to avoid exposure
    to the sun.
    <br><br>
    You'll usually need to use azelaic acid for a month before your acne improves.
    <br><br>
    The side effects of azelaic acid are usually mild and include:
    <ul>
    <li>burning or stinging skin</li>
    <li>itchiness</li>
    <li>dry skin</li>
    <li>redness of the skin</li>
</ul>

</p>


<h3>5.Antibiotic tablets</h3>
<p>
    Antibiotic tablets (oral antibiotics) are usually used in combination with a topical treatment to treat more
    severe acne.
<br><br>
    In most cases, a class of antibiotics called tetracyclines is prescribed, unless you're pregnant or breastfeeding.
<br><br>
    Pregnant or breastfeeding women are usually advised to take an antibiotic called erythromycin, which is known to
    be safer to use.
<br><br>
    It usually takes about six weeks before you notice an improvement in your acne.
<br><br>
    Depending on how well you react to the treatment, a course of oral antibiotics can last four to six months.
<br><br>
    Tetracyclines can make your skin sensitive to sunlight and UV light, and can also make the oral contraceptive pill
    less effective during the first few weeks of treatment.
<br><br>
    You'll need to use an alternative method of contraception, such as condoms, during this time.
</p>


<h3>6.Hormonal therapies</h3>
<p>
    Hormonal therapies can often benefit women with acne, especially if the acne flares up around periods or is
    associated with hormonal conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome.
	<br><br>
    If you don't already use it, your GP may recommend the combined oral contraceptive pill, even if you're not sexually active.
    This combined pill can often help improve acne in women, but may take up to a year before the full benefits are seen.
</p>

<h3>7.Co-cyprindiol</h3>
<p>
    Co-cyprindiol is a hormonal treatment that can be used for more severe acne that doesn't respond to antibiotics.
    It helps to reduce the production of sebum.
	<br><br>
    You'll probably have to use co-cyprindiol for two to six months before you notice a significant improvement in your acne.
    There's a small risk that women taking co-cyprindiol may develop breast cancer in later life.
	<br><br>
    For example, out of a group of 10,000 women who haven't taken co-cyprindiol, you would expect 16 of them to develop breast
    cancer by the time they were 35. This figure rises to 17 or 18 for women who were treated with co-cyprindiol for at
    least five years in their early twenties.
    <br><br>
    There's also a very small chance of co-cyprindiol causing a blood clot. The risk is estimated to be around 1 in
    2,500 in any given year.
    <br><br>
    It's not thought to be safe to take co-cyprindiol if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. Women may need to have a
    pregnancy test before treatment can begin.
    <br><br>
    Other side effects of co-cyprindiol include:
    <ul>
    <li>bleeding and spotting between your periods, which can sometimes occur for the first few months</li>
    <li>headaches</li>
    <li>sore breasts</li>
    <li>mood changes</li>
    <li>loss of interest in sex</li>
    <li>weight gain or weight loss</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3>8.Isotretinoin</h3>
<p>
    Isotretinoin has a number of beneficial effects:
    <ul>
    <li>it helps to normalise sebum and reduce how much is produced</li>
    <li>it helps to normalise sebum and reduce how much is produced</li>
    <li>it helps to prevent follicles becoming clogged</li>
    <li>it decreases the amount of bacteria on the skin</li>
    <li>it reduces redness and swelling in and around spots</li>
  
</ul>
    However, the drug can also cause a wide range of side effects. It's only recommended for severe cases of
acne that haven't responded to other treatments.
    <br><br>
    Because of the risk of side effects, isotretinoin can only be prescribed by a specially trained GP or a dermatologist.
    <br><br>
    Isotretinoin is taken as a tablet. Most people take a four- to six-month course. Your acne may get worse during the
first 7 to 10 days of treatment. However, this is normal and soon settles.
    <br><br>
    Common side effects of isotretinoin include:
    <ul>
    <li>inflammation, dryness and cracking of the skin, lips and nostrils</li>
    <li>changes in your blood sugar levels</li>
    <li>inflammation of your eyelids (blepharitis)</li>
    <li>inflammation and irritation of your eyes (conjunctivitis)</li>
    <li>blood in your urine</li>
</ul>
    Rarer side effects of isotretinoin include:
<ul>
    <li>inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)</li>
    <li>inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)</li>
    <li>kidney disease</li>

</ul>
Because of the risk of these rarer side effects, you'll need a blood test before and during treatment.
