Male pattern baldness (alopecia), or androgenetic alopecia, is the patterned 
balding of a man. Although the condition may affect both the appearance and 
self-esteem of some men, one should note that the condition is not a medical
 disorder. The hair loss is non-scarring and has a genetic basis. Sex steroids 
 (androgens) – specifically, dihydrotestosterone – play a role in this form of 
 balding.
 <br><br>
According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM), more than 50 percent 
of all men over the age of 50 will be affected by male pattern baldness to some extent.

Male pattern baldness can begin in your teenage years, but it more commonly
 occurs in adult men, with the likelihood increasing with age. Genetics 
 plays a big role. Men who have close relatives with male pattern baldness 
 are at a higher risk. This is particularly true when their relatives are 
 on the maternal side of the family.
 <br><br>
Male pattern baldness may be hastened by other forms of hair loss, such as 
chemotherapy-induced hair loss. Likewise, male pattern baldness becomes 
more common as age increases.

In female pattern baldness, the hair’s growing phase slows down. It also takes 
longer for new hair to begin growing. Hair follicles shrink, leading the hair 
that does grow to be thinner and finer. This can result in hair that easily breaks.
<br><br>
It’s normal for women to lose 50 to 100 hairs each day, but those with female 
pattern baldness can lose many more.
<br><br>
In men, hair loss starts in the front of the head and recedes to the back until 
they go bald. Women lose hair from all over their head, starting at their part 
line. Hair at the temples may also recede.
<br><br>
Woman are less likely to go completely bald, but you may have a lot of thinning 
throughout your hair.
<br><br>
Doctors divide female pattern baldness into three types:

 <ul>
    <li>Type I is a small amount of thinning that starts around your part.</li>
    <li>Type II involves widening of the part, and increased thinning around it.</li>
	<li>Type III is thinning throughout, with a see-through area at the top of your scalp.</li>
	
</ul>

Hair loss is passed down from parents to their children, and many different genes are
 involved. You can inherit these genes from either parent. You’re more likely to have
 female pattern baldness if your mother, father, or other close relatives have 
 experienced hair loss.

  Women are less likely to develop female pattern baldness before midlife. Like men, 
women are more likely to start losing hair once they get into their 40s, 50s, and beyond.
<br><br>
High levels of male sex hormones, called androgens, contribute to hair loss in men. 
It’s generally felt that androgens are also at play in female pattern hair loss.
<br><br>
Smoking may also increase your risk for developing female pattern hair loss.

The diagnosis of female pattern baldness is usually easy for the physician because 
of the typical pattern. However, certain blood tests will help to rule out other causes
 such as anemia (low blood count) or a thyroid disorder. A skin biopsy may be recommended.
<br><br>
Current therapies are aimed at stimulating regrowth of terminal hairs and might include 
topical minoxidil, and the oral medications spironolactone or cyproterone acetate (not 
available in the US). Finasteride, also an oral medication, is approved for male balding
 only, and studies show no effect for female pattern hair loss.
<br><br>
Finasteride, spironolactone, and cyproterone should not be used in women of childbearing 
potential.
<br><br>
Surgical therapy to improve the appearance includes scalp reduction, flaps, and hair 
transplants (micrografting). Not everyone is a good candidate for these procedures.

If you have female pattern baldness, you may be able to camouflage the hair loss 
at first by adopting a new hairstyle. Eventually, you might have too much thinning 
at the top of your scalp to hide.
<br><br>
Early diagnosis is encouraged, as it can enable you to get on a treatment plan and 
potentially minimize future hair loss. Your treatment plan will likely consist of one or
 more medications approved to treat hair loss.


<h3>1.Minoxidil</h3>
<p>
Minoxidil (Rogaine) is the only drug approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration
 (FDA) to treat female pattern baldness. It’s available in 2% or 5% formulas. 
 If possible, opt for the 5% formula.
<br><br>
To use, apply minoxidil to your scalp every day. Though it won’t fully restore all 
the hair you’ve lost, minoxidil can grow back a significant amount of hair and give 
your hair an overall thicker appearance.
<br><br>
You probably won’t start to see results for 6 to 12 months. You’ll need to keep
 using minoxidil to maintain the effect, or it will stop working. If it stops working,
 your hair may return to its previous appearance.
 <br><br>
The following side effects are possible:

 <ul>
    <li>redness</li>
    <li>dryness</li>
	<li>itching</li>
	<li>hair growth on areas where you didn’t want it, such as your cheeks</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>2.Finasteride and dutasteride</h3>
<p>
Finasteride (Propecia) and dutasteride (Avodart) are FDA-approved to treat hair 
loss in men. They’re not approved for women, but some doctors do recommend them 
for female pattern baldness.
<br><br>
Studies are mixed as to whether these drugs work in women, but some research has 
shown that they do help regrow hair in female pattern baldness.
<br><br>
Side effects can include headaches, hot flashes, and a decreased sex drive, 
especially during the first year of use. Women shouldn’t get pregnant while 
on this drug, because it can increase the risk for birth defects.
</p>

<h3>3.Spironolactone</h3>
<p>
Spironolactone (Aldactone) is a diuretic, which means it removes excess fluid 
from the body. It also blocks androgen production, and it may help regrow hair in women.
<br><br>
This drug can cause a number of side effects, including:
 <ul>
    <li>electrolyte imbalances</li>
    <li>fatigue</li>
	<li>spotting between periods</li>
	<li>irregular menstruation</li>
	<li>tender breasts</li>
	</ul>
You may need to have regular blood pressure and electrolyte tests while you take this drug. 
If you’re pregnant or plan to become pregnant, you shouldn’t use this medication. 
Spironolactone may cause birth defects.
</p>

<h3>4.Other options</h3>
<p>
If low iron is contributing to your hair loss, your doctor might prescribe an iron supplement.
 At this time, there isn’t any evidence that taking iron will regrow your hair. Other 
 supplements, such as biotin and folic acid, are also promoted to thicken hair.
<br><br>
One study did show that women developed thicker hair after taking omega-3 fatty acids, 
omega-6 fatty acids, and antioxidants. However, it’s best to check with your doctor before 
taking any supplements to re-grow hair.
<br><br>
Laser combs and helmets are FDA-approved to treat hair loss. They use light energy to 
stimulate hair regrowth. More research needs to be done to determine if this is truly effective.
<br><br>
Platelet-rich plasma therapy may also be beneficial. This involves drawing your blood, 
spinning it down, then injecting your own platelets back into your scalp to stimulate hair 
growth. Though promising, more studies need to be done.
<br><br>
You may be able to conceal hair loss by wearing a wig or using a spray hair product.
<br><br>
A hair transplant is a more permanent solution. During this procedure, your doctor removes a 
thin strip of hair from one part of your scalp and implants it in an area where you’re missing
 hair. The graft regrows like your natural hair.

Female pattern baldness isn’t reversible. Proper treatment can stop the hair loss and 
potentially help regrow some of the hair you’ve already lost. Treatments can take up 
to 12 months to start working. You’ll need to stay on them long-term to keep from 
losing your hair again.

You can’t prevent female pattern baldness, but you can protect your hair from breakage and loss:

 <ul>
    <li>Eat a healthy diet. Get enough iron from foods like dark green leafy 
	vegetables, beans, and fortified cereals.</li>
    <li>Avoid treatments that can break or damage your hair, such as straightening
	irons, bleach, and perms.</li>
	<li>Ask your doctor if any of the medicines you take can promote hair loss. If so, 
	see if you can switch to another drug.</li>
	<li>Don’t smoke. It damages hair follicles and can speed up hair loss.</li>
	<li>Wear a hat when you go outside. Too much sun exposure can damage your hair.</li>

Actinic cheilitis can be prevented by protecting the lips from sun exposure. 
In smokers, the risk of cancer can be reduced by smoking cessation.
<br><br>
These are similar to ways to protect yourself from sun damage in general:

 <ul>
    <li>Wear a hat with a wide brim that shades your face.</li>
    <li>Use lip balm with an sun proof of at least 15. Put it on before you
	go into the sun, and reapply it often.</li>
	<li>Take breaks from the sun when possible.</li>
	<li>Avoid being outside in midday, when the sun is strongest.</li>

The hair loss associated with female pattern baldness, although permanent, requires 
no treatment if you are comfortable with your appearance.
<br><br>
Hair loss can have a significant psychologic impact, particularly in western society, 
which puts such a large emphasis on appearance.
<br><br>
For mild to moderate hair thinning, creative hair styling, hair weaving, or hairpieces 
may be adequate to improve appearance. Protect the scalp from sunburn with a hat.
<br><br>
The only medication approved to treat women in the US is topical minoxidil; the 2% 
preparation recommended for women is available over the counter. This may help hair 
to grow in a quarter of the women using it, and it will stop or slow hair loss in the 
majority of users. The medication is expensive, however, and the hair will fall out 
when its use is discontinued.
<br><br>
There is no known prevention for hair loss; shampooing and other hair products have no 
adverse effects other than harsh products or practices that may damage the hair shaft, 
causing breakage.
