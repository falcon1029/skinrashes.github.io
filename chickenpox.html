        <h2>What is chickenpox?</h2>
<p>
    Chickenpox, also called varicella, is characterized by itchy red blisters that appear all over the body. 
A virus causes this condition. It often affects children, and was so common it was considered a 
childhood rite of passage.<br><br>
It's very rare to have the chickenpox infection more than once. And since the chickenpox vaccine
was introduced in the mid-1990s, cases have declined.

      <h2>What are the symptoms of chickenpox?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    An itchy rash is the most common symptom of chickenpox. The infection will have to be in your 
body for around seven to 21 days before the rash and other symptoms develop. You start to be contagious 
to those around you up to 48 hours before the skin rash starts to occur.<br>

The non-rash symptoms may last a few days and include:

<ul>
<li>fever</li>
<li>headache</li>
<li>loss of appetite</li>
</ul>
One or two days after you experience these symptoms, the classic rash will begin to develop. The rash goes
 through three phases before you recover. These include:

<ul>
<li>You develop red or pink bumps all over your body.fever</li>
<li>The bumps become blisters filled with fluid that leaks.</li>
<li>The bumps become crusty, scab over, and begin to heal.</li>
</ul>

The bumps on your body will not all be in the same phase at the same time. New bumps will 
continuously appear throughout your infection. The rash may be very itchy, especially before 
it scabs over with a crust.<br><br>

You are still contagious until all the blisters on your body have scabbed over. The crusty scabbed areas 
eventually fall off. It takes seven to 14 days to disappear completely.

      <h2>What causes chickenpox?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
  Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes the chickenpox infection. Most cases occur through contact 
with an infected person. The virus is contagious to those around you for one to two days before
 your blisters appear. VZV remains contagious until all blisters have crusted over. The virus can 
spread through:

<ul>
<li>saliva</li>
<li>coughing</li>
<li>sneezing</li>
<li>contact with fluid from the blisters</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>





<div class="card">
    <div class="header">
      <h2>Who is at risk of developing the chicken pox?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
   Exposure to the virus through previous active infection or vaccination reduces risk. Immunity from the
 virus can be passed on from a mother to her newborn. Immunity lasts about three months from birth.<br><br>

Anyone who has not been exposed may contract the virus. Risk increases under any of these conditions:
<ul>
<li>You have had recent contact with an infected person.</li>
<li>You are under 12 years of age.</li>
<li>You are an adult living with children.</li>
<li>You have spent time in a school or child care facility.</li>
<li>Your immune system is compromised due to illness or medications.</li>
</ul>

      <h2>How is chickenpox diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
  You or your child should not usually need any medical tests to diagnose chickenpox. You can be
 pretty sure that it is chickenpox if there are the key symptoms of a mild fever followed by an itchy rash, 
blisters and scabs. Chickenpox is a common viral illness that can have serious complications so seek
 help if unsure of the diagnosis.<br><br>

Chickenpox spots are usually distinctive enough to distinguish from other rashes, although occasionally they 
can be easily confused with other conditions that affect the skin, such as insect bites or scabies (a contagious skin 
condition that causes intense itching).<br><br>

If you're still uncertain about what is causing the symptoms, your doctor can carry out a simple blood test to
 identify the virus.<br><br>

      <h2>Possible complications of chickenpox</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
 Call your doctor right away if:

<ul>
<li>The rash spreads to your eyes.</li>
<li>The rash is very red, tender, and warm (signs of a secondary bacterial infection).</li>
<li>The rash is accompanied by dizziness or shortness of breath.</li>
</ul>

When complications occur, they most often affect:
<ul>
<li>infants</li>
<li>older adults</li>
<li>people with weak immune systems</li>
<li>pregnant women</li>
</ul>

These groups may also contract VZV pneumonia or bacterial infections of the skin, joints, or bones.<br><br>
Women exposed during pregnancy may bear children with birth defects, including:

<ul>
<li>poor growth</li>
<li>small head size</li>
<li>eye problems</li>
<li>intellectual disabilities</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Treatments for chickenpox </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Chickenpox is usually mild and can be treated at home. Most people feel better within a 
week or so.
There's no cure, but the treatments below can help relieve the symptoms while the body fights 
the infection.
It's also important to take steps to prevent chickenpox spreading, such as staying off work or 
school until the last blister has dried and crusted over.



<h3>Painkillers</h3>
<p>

Use paracetamol if you or your child have a high temperature (fever) and feel uncomfortable.
<br>
Paracetamol is safe for most people to take,including pregnant women and children over
 two months of age. Special liquid versions are available for young children and babies.
<br>
Don't use anti-inflammatory painkillers, such as ibuprofen, as they can sometimes make
 people with chickenpox very ill. Never give aspirin to a child under 16 as it can be dangerous for them.
<br>
Always read the packet or leaflet that comes with the medicine to check if it's suitable and 
how much to take. Speak to a pharmacist or your GP if you're unsure.
</p>

<h3>Prevent itching and scratching</h3>
<p>
   Chickenpox can be very itchy, but it's important not to scratch the spots 
   as it can increase the chances of the skin becoming infected with bacteria 
   and could result in scarring.<br>
  It can help to:
  
  <ul>
<li>keep nails short and clean</li>
<li>tap or pat the skin instead of scratching it</li>
<li>wear cotton gloves at night (or socks over hands)</li>
<li>bathe in cool or lukewarm water,dab or pat the skin dry afterwards,
rather than rubbing it</li>
<li>wear loose, smooth cotton clothing</li>
</ul>
  You can also buy calamine lotion, moisturising creams, cooling gels or 
  an antihistamine medicine called chlorpheniramine to help reduce itching 
  and soothe the skin.
</p>

<h3>Food and drink</h3>
<p>
It's important to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.
<br>
Water is better than sugary, fizzy or acidic drinks, particularly if
you or your child has chickenpox spots in the mouth.
<br>
Sugar-free ice lollies are also a good way of getting fluids into children 
and can help soothe a sore mouth.
<br>
Avoid sharp, hard, salty or spicy foods that may make the mouth sore. Soft, 
cool foods are best, such as soup that has been left to cool down.
<br>
If you breastfeed or bottle feed your baby, continue to give them feeds regularly.
</p>


<h3>Stronger treatments from a doctor</h3>
<p>
Antiviral medication or a treatment called immunoglobulin may be recommended 
if you're at risk of developing severe chickenpox.<br>
Those at risk include:
    <ul>
        <li>pregnant women</li>
        <li>adults, especially those who smoke</li>
        <li>newborn babies under four weeks old</li>
        <li>people with a weakened immune system (the body's defence system), 
		such as people with HIV, those taking high doses of steroid medication 
		and those having chemotherapy</li>
        
    </ul>

</p>

<h3>Antiviral medication</h3>

<p>
An antiviral medicine called aciclovir may be recommended if you're at risk 
of severe chickenpox and you already have symptoms.<br>
It ideally needs to be started within 24 hours of the rash appearing. It doesn't 
cure chickenpox, but makes the symptoms less severe.<br>
It's normally taken as tablets five times a day for seven days.

</p>

<h3>Immunoglobulin</h3>

<p>
Immunoglobulin is a treatment given by injection that can help prevent severe 
chickenpox if you've been exposed to someone with the infection but don't have 
any symptoms yet.<br>
It's sometimes given to pregnant women, people with a weakened immune system 
and newborn babies who've been exposed to the chickenpox virus and haven't 
had the infection before.<br>

      <h2>Chickenpox vaccine</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The chickenpox vaccine protects against the varicella zoster virus that causes chickenpox.<br>
The chickenpox vaccine is not part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule.<br>
It is currently only offered on the NHS to people who are in close contact with someone 
who is particularly vulnerable to chickenpox or its complications.<br>
There are two chickenpox vaccines currently available. The brand names of the 
chickenpox vaccine are VARIVAX and VARILRIX.<br>

      <h2>How can chickenpox be prevented?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The chickenpox vaccine prevents chickenpox in 98 percent of people who receive 
the two recommended doses. Your child should get the shot when they are between 
12 and 15 months of age. Children get a booster between 4 and 6 years of age.<br><br>

Older children and adults who haven't been vaccinated or exposed may receive
catch-up doses of the vaccine. As chickenpox tends to be more severe in older
 adults, people who haven't been vaccinated may opt to get the shots later.<br><br>

People unable to receive the vaccine can try to avoid the virus by limiting contact 
with infected people. But this can be difficult. Chickenpox can't be identified by
its blisters until it has already been spreadable to others for days.<br><br>

      <h2>The long-term outlook</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The body can resolve most cases of chickenpox on its own. People usually return 
to normal activities within one to two weeks of diagnosis.<br><br>

Once chickenpox heals, most people become immune to the virus. It won't be reactivated
because VZV typically stays dormant in the body of a healthy person. In rare cases,
 it may re-emerge to cause another episode of chickenpox.<br><br>

It is more common for shingles, a separate disorder also triggered by VZV, to occur
 later during adulthood. If a person's immune system is temporarily weakened, VZV may
 reactivate in the form of shingles. This usually occurs due to advanced age or having 
 a debilitating illness.<br><br>
