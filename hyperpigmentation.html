        <h2>What is Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation?</h2>
<p>
Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is darkening of the skin in an area of prior 
injury or skin disorder from increased pigment (melanin) left from the healing 
process. Sometimes the darkening may also be due to an iron pigment left behind 
when old red blood cells die. Acne is a common cause as well as any type of skin 
injury (scrapes, cuts, burns, insect bites, or chronic rubbing) or many other 
skin disorders, such as eczema (atopic dermatitis).

     <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation can occur in anyone, but is more common in darker 
skinned individuals, in whom the colour tends to be more intense and persist for a 
longer period than in lighter skin colours. Pigmentation tends to more pronounced 
in sun-induced skin conditions such as <b>phytophotodermatitis</b> and <b>lichenoid dermatoses</b>
 (skin conditions with lichen planus-like inflammation, such as erythema dyschromicum perstans).
<br><br>
Some medications may also darken postinflammatory pigmentation. These include
 <b>antimalarial drugs, clofazimine, tetracycline, </b>anticancer drugs such as <b>bleomycin 
 (flagellate erythema), doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and busulfan.</b>

     <h2>Causes of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation follows damage to the epidermis and/or dermis with 
deposition of melanin within the keratinocytes (skin cells) and/or dermis.
<br><br>
Inflammation in the epidermis stimulates melanocytes to increase melanin synthesis and to
 transfer the pigment to surrounding keratinocytes (epidermal melanosis). If the basal 
 layer is injured (e.g. lichen planus), melanin pigment is released and subsequently 
 trapped by macrophages in the papillary dermis (dermal melanosis or pigment incontinence).

     <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
One or more areas of darker brown or sometimes red-brown discoloration. The appearance 
varies in size, shape, and location depending upon the cause of skin injury. Acne tends
 to leave light to dark brown spots on the face or trunk. Burns, insect bites, cuts, 
 or scrapes often affect exposed areas on the arms and legs.

     <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Most post-inflammatory pigment fades with time, although it takes many months, and 
some areas never fade (particularly on the legs).
<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Since sunlight may cause further darkening, protect yourself from sun exposure with 
<b>clothing, a hat, and sunscreen (SPF 15 or more).</b></li>
<li>You may be able to use<b> makeup </b>to cover the affected areas. Waterproof makeup is 
available for use on arms and legs.</li>
<li>If you have an underlying skin disorder such as acne, seek medical care.</li>
<li>While <b>bleaching creams</b> are available over the counter (0.5–2% hydroquinone 
in the US and stronger, but possibly dangerous, concentrations overseas), weaker
 forms have limited effectiveness, and there is some concern about their safety. 
 In fact, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering removing them from 
 the market. If you do try them, stop using them if there is no improvement after 
 4–6 months of use. The stronger foreign products may worsen pigmentation with 
 overuse or cause permanent pigment loss, so DO NOT USE THEM.</li>
<li><b>Cocoa butter and aloe</b> are common home remedies, but they have not been 
proven to be effective.</li>
<li><b>Cortisone creams</b> should not be used unless recommended by your physician, 
as they thin the skin with prolonged use.</li>
</ul>

     <h2>Treatment for postinflammatory hyperpigmentation</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<p>
If pigmentation affects an exposed site, daily application of SPF 50+ 
broad-spectrum sunscreen is important to minimise darkening caused by UVR. 
Cosmetic camouflage can be used.

<h3>1.Topical treatments for postinflammatory hyperpigmentation</h3>

<p>
A variety of topical treatments are available to lighten/bleach hyperpigmented 
lesions in epidermal hypermelanosis. Varying degrees of success are achieved 
but combinations of the treatments below are usually required for significant 
improvement.

<ul>
<li>Hydroquinone</li>
<li>Azelaic acid</li>
<li>Cysteamine cream</li>
<li>Vitamin C cream</li>
<li>Tretinoin cream</li>
<li>Corticosteroid creams</li>
<li>Glycolic acid peels</li>
<li>Others: kojic acid, arbutin, licorice extracts, mequinol, niacinamide, N-acetyl glucosamine, soy</li>
</ul>


</p>

<h3>2.Physical treatments for postinflammatory hyperpigmentation</h3>

<p>
Chemical peels, laser treatments and intense pulsed light therapies (IPL)
 may be helpful for epidermal pigmentation, but physical treatments may also 
 aggravate it by injuring the epidermis.
<br><br>
These treatments are not effective in dermal hypermelanosis.
