        <h2>What is Keratoacanthoma?</h2>


<p>
Keratoacanthoma (KA) is a low-grade, or slow-growing, skin cancer tumor that looks 
like a tiny dome or crater. KA is benign despite its similarities to squamous cell 
carcinoma (SCC), or the abnormal growth of cancerous cells on the skin’s most outer 
layer. KA originates in the skin’s hair follicles and rarely spreads to other cells. 
<br><br>
KA is commonly found on sun-exposed skin, such as skin on the:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>face</li>
<li>neck</li>
<li>hands</li>
<li>arms</li>
<li>legs</li>
</ul>
Treatments typically involve surgery, radiotherapy, or injections. Many doctors 
will recommend surgery to remove KA because it looks similar to the cancerous SCC. 
While untreated KA will eventually heal on its own, untreated SCC can spread to 
your lymph nodes.
<br><br>
Overall, the outlook for KA is good, as it’s a benign tumor. Read on to learn about 
the causes, risks, and how to protect yourself from getting KA.

     <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The most common locations for keratoacanthoma include:
<ul>
<li>Center of the face</li>
<li>Backs of hands</li>
<li>Forearms</li>
<li>Ears</li>
<li>Scalp</li>
<li>Lower legs, especially in women</li>
</ul>
A keratoacanthoma appears and grows rapidly over the course of 2–6 weeks. Starting 
as a small, pimple-like lesion, a keratoacanthoma typically develops into a dome-shaped, 
skin-colored nodule with a central depression filled with keratin (the major protein 
found in hair, skin, and nails). Keratoacanthoma usually range in size from 1–2.5 cm.
<br><br>
In rare cases, multiple keratoacanthomas may develop as part of a larger group of 
symptoms (syndrome).
<br><br>
Most keratoacanthoma are painless, though some may be itchy. Depending on the site 
of involvement, keratoacanthoma may interfere with normal function of the affected area.

     <h2>What causes keratoacanthoma?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The exact cause of KA is unknown. Some factors that may contribute to getting KA are:

<ul>
<li>sun exposure</li>
<li>contact with chemical carcinogens, or cancer-causing chemicals</li>
<li>smoking</li>
<li>infection with some strains of a wart virus, such as human papillomavirus</li>
<li>trauma</li>
<li>genetic factors</li>
</ul>
KA and SCC consist of very similar epidemiological features. This means they develop 
at similar rates and have common causes. This suggests exposure to sunlight causes KA, 
and one of the main causes of SCC is ultraviolet (UV) exposure.

     <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

Keratoacanthoma is most commonly seen in elderly, light-skinned people with a 
history of sun exposure.
<br><br>
Risk factors for the development of keratoacanthoma include:
<ul>
<li>Age over 50</li>
<li>Fair skin, light hair, or light eyes</li>
<li>Male</li>
<li>Chronic exposure to sunlight or other ultraviolet light</li>
<li>Exposure to certain chemicals, such as tar</li>
<li>Exposure to radiation, such as X-ray treatment for internal cancers</li>
<li>Long-term suppression of the immune system, such as organ transplant recipients</li>
<li>Long-term presence of scars, such as from a gasoline burn</li>
<li>Chronic ulcers</li>
<li>Presence of particular strains of the wart virus (human papillomavirus)</li>
<li>Previous skin cancer</li>

     <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
There are no effective self-care treatments for keratoacanthoma. Preventing sun damage 
is crucial to avoiding the development of keratoacanthoma:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Avoid ultraviolet (UV) light exposure from natural sunlight or from artificial
 tanning devices.</li>
<li>Wear broad-spectrum sunscreens (blocking both UVA and UVB) with SPF 30 or higher,
 reapplying frequently.</li>
<li>Wear wide-brimmed hats and long-sleeved shirts.</li>
<li>Stay out of the sun in the middle of the day (between 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM).</li>
</ul>

     <h2>Multiple keratoacanthomas</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Multiple KAs may show up as tumors that are 5 to 15 centimeters. It’s a non-melanoma 
skin cancer that rarely metastasizes, meaning it won’t spread to other areas of the 
body. But it can still be dangerous and should be treated by a doctor.
<br><br>
Many people with one KA lesion may develop more throughout their lifetime. But 
several rare conditions can cause multiple KAs to appear at once.

     <h2>How is keratoacanthoma diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
It’s possible for your doctor to diagnose KA by looking at it, but because of 
its strong resemblance to SCC, an invasive type of skin cancer, your doctor may 
prefer to do a biopsy.
<br><br>
This means your doctor will want to cut out the KA for examination. This process 
involves numbing the KA with a local anesthetic before removing enough of the lesion 
to test with a scalpel or razor. The sample is then evaluated to form a diagnosis.

    </div>

    <div class="container">
<p>
KA will go away on its own, but this can take many months. Your doctor may 
recommend surgery or medication to remove KA.
</p>

<h3>1.Removal treatments</h3>
<p>
Treatment options depend on the location of the lesion, the patient’s health history, 
and the size of the lesion. The most common treatment is a minor surgery, under a 
local anesthetic, to remove the tumor. This may require stitches, depending on the 
size of the KA.
<br><br>
Other treatments include:
<ul>
<li>If you have cryosurgery, your doctor will freeze the lesion with liquid 
nitrogen to destroy it.</li>
<li>If you have electrodesiccation and curettage, your doctor will scrap or burn 
off the growth.</li>
<li>If you have Mohs’ microscopic surgery, your doctor will continue to take tiny 
pieces of skin until the lesion is completely removed. This treatment is most often
 used on the ears, nose, hands, and lips.</li>
<li>Doctors use radiation treatment and X-ray therapy for people who are unable to 
have a surgical procedure for other health reasons.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>2.Medications</h3>
<p>
Medications are used if you aren’t considered a good candidate for surgery. 
Doctors can prescribe drugs for people who have numerous lesions.
<br><br>
The medical treatments include:
<ul>
<li>intralesional methotrexate</li>
<li>injecting a folic acid that halts DNA synthesis and kills cancer cells
<ul>
<li>intralesional 5-fluorouracil, which is an injection that blocks cancer 
cells from reproducing</li>
<li>topical 5-fluorouracil</li>
<li>bleomycin, which is an anti-tumor agent that blocks cell cycles</li>
<li>a 25 percent solution of podophyllin</li>
<li>oral acitretin, or chemical vitamin A</li>
<li>oral isotretinoin (Accutane)</li>
<li>steroids</li>
</ul>

</li>

</ul>
These medications can reduce the size and the number of lesions, making the 
removal treatments or surgeries easier and less invasive. They aren’t a substitute 
for actual surgery or other removal treatments. Ask your doctor about any side 
effects these medications may cause.
</p>

<h3>3.Home care</h3>
<p>
Home care involves treating the site of the tumor after it’s removed to help 
the skin in the area heal. Your doctor will provide you with specific instructions, 
including to keep the area dry and covered while it heals.
<br><br>
The treatment doesn’t stop completely after the lesion is removed. Once you’ve had KA, 
it’s common for it to reoccur, so you’ll want to regularly go to follow-up appointments 
with your dermatologist or primary care physician. Maintaining healthy habits to protect
 your skin from the sun can help prevent reoccurring lesions.

      <h2>The outlook for people with keratoacanthoma</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
KA is curable and isn’t life-threatening. The majority of KA lesions will only cause 
cosmetic scars at their worst.
<br><br>
However, some may spread to lymph nodes if left untreated. If it spreads, the risks 
increase significantly with less than a 20 percent 10-year survival rate. If cancer 
spreads from one location to another, then there’s less than a 10 percent chance for 
a 10-year survival rate.
<br><br>
People who develop KA are at a higher risk for future episodes. If you’ve had a KA tumor 
or lesion, schedule regular visits with your doctor so you can quickly identify and treat 
KA growths at an early stage. The doctor you see can be a dermatologist or a doctor with 
experience examining the skin for skin cancer and lesions.
<br><br>
If you’re concerned about a lesion or unusual mole, make an appointment with your doctor. 
Similarly, if a spot suddenly changes form, color, or shape, or starts to itch or bleed, 
ask your doctor to check it.

        <h2>Preventing keratoacanthoma</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
You can take steps to prevent KA by protecting your skin from the sun. Staying out 
of the sun in the middle of the day can help reduce direct sun exposure. You’ll 
also want to avoid any artificial UV lights, such as those that come from tanning beds.
<br><br>
Wear clothing that covers large portions of your skin and sunscreen with at least an 
SPF of 30. You’ll want to make sure that your sunscreen blocks both UVA and UVB light.
<br><br>
You can also regularly examine your skin for new or growing moles or colored patches. 
If you’re concerned about KA, make regular appointments with your doctor or dermatologist 
so that they can detect and promptly remove any KA tumors.
