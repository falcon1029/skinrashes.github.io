        <h2>What is Telangiectasia?</h2>


<p>
Telangiectasia is a condition in which widened venules (tiny blood vessels) cause threadlike 
red lines or patterns on the skin. These patterns, or telangiectases, form gradually and often 
in clusters. They’re sometimes known as <b>“spider veins”</b> because of their fine and weblike appearance.
<br><br>
Telangiectases are common in areas that are easily seen (such as the lips, nose, eyes, fingers, 
and cheeks). They can cause discomfort and some people find them unattractive. Many people choose
 to have them removed. Removal is done by causing damage to the vessel and forcing it to collapse
 or scar. This reduces the appearance of the red marks or patterns on the skin.
<br><br>
While telangiectases are usually benign, they can be a sign of serious illness. For example, 
hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare genetic condition that causes telangiectases 
that can be life-threatening. Instead of forming on the skin, telangiectases caused by HHT appear 
in vital organs, such as the liver. They may burst, causing massive bleeding (hemorrhages).

    <h2>Recognizing the Symptoms of Telangiectasia</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Telangiectases can be uncomfortable. They are generally not life-threatening, but some people may
 not like how they look. They develop gradually, but can be worsened by health and beauty products 
 that cause skin irritation, such as abrasive soaps and sponges.
<br><br>
Symptoms include:
<ul>
<li>pain (related to pressure on venules)</li>
<li>itching</li>
<li>threadlike red marks or patterns on the skin</li>
</ul>
The symptoms of HHT include:
<ul>
<li>frequent nosebleeds</li>
<li>red or dark black blood in stools</li>
<li>shortness of breath</li>
<li>seizures</li>
<li>small strokes</li>
<li>port-wine stain birthmark</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Causes of Telangiectasia</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The exact cause of telangiectasia is unknown. Researchers believe several causes may 
contribute to the development of telangiectases. These causes may be genetic, environmental, 
or a combination of both. It is believed that most cases of telangiectasia are caused by 
chronic exposure to the sun or extreme temperatures. This is because they usually appear on 
the body where skin is often exposed to sunlight and air.
<br><br>
Other possible causes include:
<ul>
<li><b>alcoholism:</b> this can affect the flow of blood in vessels and can cause liver disease</li>
<li><b>pregnancy:</b> pregnancy often applies large amounts of pressure on venules</li>
<li><b>aging:</b> aging blood vessels can begin to weaken</li>
<li><b>rosacea:</b> enlarges venules in the face, creating a flushed appearance in cheeks and nose</li>
<li><b>habitual corticosteroid use:</b> thins and weakens the skin</li>
<li><b>scleroderma:</b> hardens and contracts the skin</li>
<li><b>dermatomyositis:</b> inflames skin and underlying muscle tissue</li>
<li><b>systemic lupus erythematosus:</b> can increase skin sensitivity to sunlight and extreme temperatures</li>
</ul>
The causes of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia are genetic. People with HHT inherit the disease 
from at least one parent. Five genes are suspected to cause HHT, and three are known. People with HHT 
receive either one normal gene and one mutated gene or two mutated genes (it only takes one mutated gene 
to cause HHT).

    <h2>Who Is at Risk of Contracting Telangiectasia?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Telangiectasia is a common skin disorder, even among healthy people. However, certain people are 
more at risk of developing telangiectases than others. This includes those who:
<ul>
<li>work outdoors</li>
<li>sit or stand all day</li>
<li>suffer from alcoholism</li>
<li>are pregnant</li>
<li>are older or elderly (telangiectases are more likely to form as skin ages)</li>
<li>have rosacea, scleroderma, dermatomyositis, or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)</li>
<li>corticosteroid use</li>
</ul>

    <h2>How Doctors Diagnose Telangiectasia</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Doctors may rely on the clinical signs of the disease. Telangiectasia is easily visible 
from the threadlike red lines or patterns on the skin. In some cases, doctors may want to make 
sure that there is no underlying disorder. Diseases associated with telangiectasia include:
<ul>
<li><b>HHT (also called Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome):</b> an inherited disorder of the blood 
vessels in skin and internal organs that can cause excessive bleeding</li>
<li><b>Sturge-Weber disease:</b> a rare disorder that causes a port-wine stain birthmark 
and nervous system problems</li>
<li><b>spider angiomas:</b> an abnormal collection of blood vessels near the surface of the skin</li>
<li><b>xeroderma pigmentosa:</b> a rare condition in which the skin and eyes are extremely 
sensitive to ultraviolet light</li>
</ul>
HHT may cause the formation of abnormal blood vessels called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).
 These may occur in several areas of the body. These AVMs allow direct connection between arteries 
 and veins without intervening capillaries. This may result in hemorrhage (severe bleeding). 
 This bleeding can be deadly if it occurs in the brain, liver, or lungs.
<br><br>
To diagnose HHT, doctors may perform an MRI or a CT scan to look for bleeding or abnormalities 
inside the body.

    <h2>Treatment of Telangiectasia</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Treatment focuses on improving the appearance of the skin. Different methods include:
<ul>
<li><b>laser therapy:</b> laser targets the widened vessel and seals it (this usually 
involves little pain and has a short recovery period)</li>
<li><b>surgery:</b> widened vessels can be removed (this can be very painful and may need a long recovery)</li>
<li><b>sclerotherapy:</b> focuses on causing damage to the inner lining of the blood vessel by 
injecting it with a chemical solution that causes a blood clot that collapses, thickens, or scars the 
venule (there’s usually no recovery needed, although there may be some temporary exercise restrictions)</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
Treatment for HHT may include:
<ul>
<li>embolization (a procedure to block or close a blood vessel)</li>
<li>laser therapy to stop bleeding</li>
<li>surgery</li>
</ul>
</div>

    <h2>Outlook for Telangiectasia</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Treatment can improve the appearance of the skin. Those who have treatment can expect to lead
 a normal life after recovery. Depending on the parts of the body where the AVMs are located, 
 people with HHT can also have a normal lifespan.

    <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
No treatment is necessary unless the appearance is bothersome.
 <br><br>
You might try the following:
<ul>
<li>Use cover-up makeup or self-tanning lotion to cover them up. Waterproof leg makeup is also available.</li>
<li>If in a sun-exposed area, use sun-protection measures, such as a hat or sunscreen.</li>
<li>If you have been using topical corticosteroid cream, stop its use on the affected area.</li>
</ul>
