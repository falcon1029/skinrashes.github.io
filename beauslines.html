        <h2>What is Beau's Lines?</h2>
Beau's lines are horizontal (transverse) depressions in the nail plate that 
run parallel to the shape of the white, moon-shaped portion of the nail bed 
(lunula) seen at the nail's origin. They result from a sudden interruption of 
nail keratin synthesis and grow distally with the nail plate. As the nail grows, 
the Beau's lines can disappear.
<br><br>
Beau's lines can be caused by trauma or local disease involving the nail fold. 
They can vary based upon the width or depth of the depression, reflecting the 
duration or extent of the damage. When Beau's lines are present in all nails 
at a similar location on the nail plate, they are likely to have a systemic cause. 
They may also result from metabolic, inflammatory, or traumatic influences.

      <h2>Causes and symptoms of Beau's Lines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Fingernails are made by living skin cells in your fingers. So a skin condition 
such as eczema may lead to fingernail ridges. Skin dryness can also cause these ridges.
 If your body is low in protein, calcium, zinc, or vitamin A, a deficiency can 
 sometimes be revealed by ridges in your fingernails.


<h3>Vertical ridges</h3>

<p>
Vertical ridges are furrows that run from the tip of your fingernail down to 
the cuticle. They are sometimes called longitudinal striations or bands.
<br><br>
Slight vertical ridges in fingernails often develop in older adults, possibly 
due to a slowing of cell turnover. This is when new skin cells produced below 
the surface of your skin rise up to take the place of dead cells that are discarded
 from the surface.
<br><br>
If you experience other symptoms like color or texture changes in your nails, it 
may be caused by a medical condition. In trachyonychia, or 20-nail dystrophy, the 
ridges may be accompanied by a change in color to your nails, or your nails may
 become rough or brittle.
<br><br>
Iron deficiency anemia can also trigger vertical ridges and changes to your nails 
that make them concave, or spoon-shaped.
</p>


<h3>Horizontal ridges</h3>

<p>
Deep horizontal ridges, called Beau’s lines, are often symptoms of a serious condition.
 They may actually stop nail growth until the underlying condition is treated. 
 Acute kidney disease may also be present if Beau’s lines appear. In addition, 
 when Beau’s lines develop on all 20 nails, it could be a symptom of:
 <ul>
    <li>mumps</li>
    <li>thyroid disease</li>
	<li>diabetes</li>
	<li>syphilis</li>
</ul>
 Chemotherapy may also cause Beau’s lines.
<br><br>
Trauma to your nails can cause red or brown spots to form underneath your nails. 
However, if you notice dark brown, black, or red color changes under your nails 
and you haven’t experienced nail trauma, this can be a symptom of a more serious 
condition, such as endocarditis or melanoma.

      <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
People of all ages and ethnic backgrounds can have Beau's lines. Most commonly,
 they are seen in chemotherapy patients in reaction to a drug.

      <h2>Diagnosing the cause of fingernail ridges</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

Sudden changes in your nails should be examined by your doctor. If you damaged 
your nail in an injury, you may wait to see how the nail and your finger heal 
for a few weeks before deciding whether to see a doctor.
<br><br>
However, you should see your doctor as soon as possible if the injury resulted in:

<ul>
    <li>a clean or ragged cut through your nail</li>
    <li>a crushed nail</li>
	<li>a nail being torn off</li>
	<li>bleeding under your nail</li>
</ul>

During your appointment, your doctor will examine your nails and ask about 
any other symptoms you’re experiencing.
<br><br>
Your doctor may order urine and blood tests if they suspect kidney disease, 
diabetes, or nutritional deficiencies.
<br><br>
If it appears the ridges are the result of a skin condition, a dermatologist 
can start you on a treatment plan.
<br><br>
If the cause of your fingernail ridges is unclear, your dermatologist may take 
some fingernail clippings to have them analyzed in a lab for signs of infection.

      <h2>Treating Beau's lines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Because fingernail ridges are usually signs of other health problems, treatment 
is focused on the underlying cause of the changes to your nails. For example, 
if you’ve developed Beau’s lines because of diabetes, successfully controlling 
your blood sugar may reduce these horizontal fingernail ridges.
<br><br>
Treatment for skin conditions such as eczema may include moisturizers for your
 hands or topical ointments to reduce eczema symptoms. If low levels of minerals 
 or vitamins are to blame, you may be advised to alter your diet or take 
 supplements to boost your levels.
<br><br>
Buffing your fingernails with an emery board may help smooth ridges. Ask your
 dermatologist for advice on treating your nails. You’ll want to be careful 
 not to press too hard to avoid further damage.

      <h2>Outlook</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Most of the time, ridges in fingernails are normal signs of aging. However, 
it’s important to pay attention to fingernail ridges and other nail changes. 
These might be the first signs of a serious medical problem.
