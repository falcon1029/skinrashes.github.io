<h2>What is pemphigus vulgaris?</h2>

<p>
   Pemphigus vulgaris is a rare autoimmune disease that causes painful blistering on the 
   skin and mucous membranes. If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system mistakenly 
   attacks your healthy tissues.
<br><br>
Pemphigus vulgaris is the most common type of a group of autoimmune disorders called pemphigus. 
Each type of pemphigus is characterized by the location where the blisters form.
<br><br>
Pemphigus vulgaris affects the mucous membranes, which are found in areas including the:
<ul>
        <li>mouth</li>
        <li>throat</li>
        <li>nose</li>
        <li>eyes</li>
        <li>genitals</li>
		<li>lungs</li>
    </ul>

	This disease usually starts with blisters in the mouth and then on the skin. The blisters 
	sometimes affect the membranes of the genitals.
<br><br>
Pemphigus vulgaris can be dangerous. Treatment is essential, and typically it involves the 
use of corticosteroids to suppress the immune system. The condition can cause serious 
complications it isn’t treated. Some of these complications can be fatal.
<br><br>
The death rate from this disease had averaged 75 percent before corticosteroids were introduced 
in the 1950s. This has improved dramatically with today’s treatments.

     <h2>What causes pemphigus vulgaris?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Our immune system makes antibodies that are required to fight infection. Normally 
	these antibodies do not attack our own body systems.  However, in an autoimmune disease, 
	the immune system attacks our own body. In pemphigus vulgaris the immune system makes 
	antibodies (auto antibodies) that attack the skin and mucous membrane leading to damage 
	that causes blisters to develop.
<ul>
        <li>The auto antibodies in pemphigus vulgaris attack proteins called desmogleins. 
		The desmoglein proteins are present on the cells in the outer layer of the skin 
		(the epidermis). Desmogleins normally act as a glue to hold the cells of the 
		epidermis together.</li>
        <li>When the auto antibodies formed in pemphigus vulgaris attack the desmoglein protein, 
		the cells in the skin and mucous membranes no longer hold together and separate. 
		This causes the blisters and erosions that are typical of pemphigus vulgaris.</li>
        <li>Although it is known that antibodies to desmoglein cause pemphigus vulgaris, 
		it is still not clear why some people develop these auto antibodies.</li>
       
    </ul>
	
	Pemphigus vulgaris affects males and females equally. It can start at any age but 
	is most common in adults between 50-60 years old. It affects people of all races but 
	is more common in some people, for example, people of Jewish origin.  Pemphigus vulgaris 
	is not an infection and so it cannot be caught or passed on to anyone else.


<h3>Is pemphigus vulgaris hereditary?</h3>
<p>
    Strictly speaking it is not, as it does not pass from generation to generation. Genetic factors are important,
    but other factors are needed to trigger pemphigus vulgaris into activity.

     <h2>What does pemphigus vulgaris look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<p>
    In most patients, the blisters and erosions start first in the mouth, and appear later on the skin. In a few,
    the skin is affected first. Most patients get erosions in their mouth at some time; but some never get blisters
    or erosions on their skin.
	</p>

   <h3>The skin:</h3>
<p>
    The skin lesions start as thin-walled blisters (collections of clear fluid within the skin), arising on a background
    of normal-looking skin. Because they are so fragile, pemphigus blisters break very easily, leaving raw areas known
    as erosions.
    Erosions are areas of skin (or mucous membrane), which lack its top (outer) layer. They look raw and feel sore -
    like a burn. Erosions can join together to create larger areas of raw skin that look as if the top layer has been scraped off.
    Erosions can become crusty and scabbed. When they heal, those on the skin may leave discoloured marks.
  
</p>
<h3>The mouth:</h3>
<p>
    Intact blisters are seldom seen in the mouth in pemphigus vulgaris because they get broken so easily.
    Erosions are seen there instead. There may be just one or two, or several that can join together.

     <h2>Will pemphigus vulgaris go away?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    No, it will not clear without treatment. There will be times when it flares up, and others when it gets better.
    There is no way of knowing when these flare-ups will happen or how bad they will be. However, pemphigus vulgaris
    can be controlled by long-term treatment and may eventually get better completely, so that it does not flare up
    when treatment stops.

     <h2>How will pemphigus vulgaris be diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Pemphigus vulgaris is rare and most general practitioners may have never seen it. Your own doctor will send you to
    see a dermatologist or an oral medicine specialist, who will make a provisional diagnosis of the condition on the
    basis of the changes seen on your skin and in your mouth.
<br><br>
    Next a biopsy will be taken. This is a sample of an unbroken blister. It will be processed in the laboratory and then
    examined under the microscope. The diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris will be confirmed by finding cells in the epidermis
    that are rounding off and separating away from each other.
<br><br>
    As further confirmation of the diagnosis, part of the biopsy specimen is likely to be examined by a technique known
    as direct immunofluorescence to demonstrate the presence of pemphigus vulgaris autoantibodies in the skin.
<br><br>
    Another useful test is to measure the levels of pemphigus vulgaris autoantibody in the blood. This is done by indirect
    immunofluorescence and is sometimes called an antibody titre test. It is a useful way of monitoring how active the
    pemphigus vulgaris is, and the results can suggest changes in treatment.

     <h2>How can pemphigus vulgaris be treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<p>

    <b>General aims. </b>Treatment is important because pemphigus vulgaris is a
    serious and potentially life threatening condition if not treated early and
    effectively. Treatment entails using medicines that are usually taken by mouth
    but are sometimes given in severe cases into a vein through a drip requiring
    admission as an inpatient. Because pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune
    disease, most treatments used work by suppressing the immune system.
    <br><br>
    The aims of treatment are to prevent new blisters forming and to heal existing
    ones. It usually takes about 2 to 3 weeks of treatment to stop new blisters
    developing, and sometimes as long as 6 to 8 weeks for healing to occur.
    Once control has been achieved, the dose of the medication can be reduced
    slowly to the lowest level needed to keep the pemphigus vulgaris under
    control. Treatment usually starts with an oral corticosteroid and may later be
    combined with a so-called ‘steroid-sparing’ drug.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Corticosteroids.</b> Pemphigus vulgaris is usually treated first with an oral
    corticosteroid. Oral corticosteroids are effective and work quicker than most
    other treatments. The corticosteroids used are synthetic versions of a natural
    hormone produced in smaller quantities by the adrenal gland and work by
    suppressing the immune system.
    <br><br>
    High doses of corticosteroid therapy, usually prednisolone, are given to bring
    the pemphigus vulgaris under control. The dose is then reduced slowly to
    minimise side effects. However, prednisolone can seldom be stopped
    completely and most patients require a small maintenance dose to keep the
    disease under control. The dose varies from person to person, and depends
    partly on the patient’s weight.
    <br><br>
    It is very important to consult your doctor if you are considering stopping your
    corticosteroid treatment. It is dangerous to stop oral corticosteroid treatment
    suddenly because your body may have stopped making its own
    corticosteroids and become dependent on the corticosteroid tablets you are
    taking for its daily requirement.
    <br><br>
    Nearly all patients gain weight on steroid treatment, however disciplined they
    are about food. It's important not to get too worried at the start of treatment
    when the crucial thing is to get the Pemphigus under control.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Steroid-sparing or adjuvant drugs.</b> Unfortunately, although they are very
    effective, corticosteroids do have many side effects. For this reason, other
    medications are often used as well. These are known as steroid-sparing drugs
    and they can work well when combined with corticosteroids.
<br><br>
    They include the following:
    <ul>
    <li>Immunosuppressive drugs: azathioprine, cyclophosphamide,
        mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin and rituximab.
    </li>
    <li>Additional drugs that may be used include: gold, methotrexate,
        tetracyclines (minocycline or doxycycline) combined with nicotinamide
        and dapsone.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
    <b>Skin and Mouth treatments (topical treatments).</b> Emollients and steroid 
	cream may be used on skin blisters and may help so that the dose of steroid 
	tablets can be reduced.
<br><br>
Mouth blisters and erosions may be treated with steroid sprays or mouthwashes and mouthwashes 
containing an antiseptic or local anaesthetic.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Other treatments.</b> Plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and rituximab 
	may be considered if high doses of oral steroids and other treatments are not effective. 
	These may also be tried in combination with steroid tablets. Further research continues 
	to find better treatments or combinations of treatment for pemphigus vulgaris.
