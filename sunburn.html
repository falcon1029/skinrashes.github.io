        <h2>What is Sunburn?</h2>

<p>
Sunburn — red, painful skin that feels hot to the touch — usually appears within a few hours after too much 
exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from sunshine or artificial sources, such as sunlamps. Sunburn may take several
 days or longer to fade.
<br><br>
Intense, repeated sun exposure that results in sunburn increases your risk of other skin damage and certain 
diseases. These include dry or wrinkled skin, dark spots, rough spots, and skin cancers, such as melanoma.
<br><br>
You can prevent sunburn and related conditions by protecting your skin. This is especially important when you're 
outdoors, even on cool or cloudy days. If you are sunburned, home remedies and treatments can help soothe your
 skin as it heals.

    <h2>Symptoms of Sunburn</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Sunburn signs and symptoms include:
<ul>
<li>Pinkness or redness</li>
<li>Skin that feels warm or hot to the touch</li>
<li>Pain, tenderness and itching</li>
<li>Swelling</li>
<li>Small fluid-filled blisters, which may break</li>
<li>Headache, fever, nausea and fatigue if the sunburn is severe</li>
</ul>
Any exposed part of your body — including your earlobes, scalp and lips — can burn. Even covered areas can burn if,
 for example, your clothing has a loose weave that allows ultraviolet (UV) light through. Your eyes, which are 
 extremely sensitive to the sun's UV light, also can burn. Sunburned eyes may feel painful or gritty.
<br><br>
Signs and symptoms of sunburn usually appear within a few hours after sun exposure. But it may take a day or 
longer to know the full extent of your sunburn.
<br><br>
Within a few days, your body may start to heal itself by "peeling" the top layer of damaged skin. After peeling, 
your skin may temporarily have an irregular color and pattern. A bad sunburn may take several days or longer 
to heal.

    <h2>When to see a doctor</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
See your doctor if the sunburn:
<ul>
<li>Is blistering and covers a large portion of your body</li>
<li>Is accompanied by a high fever, extreme pain, headache, confusion, nausea or chills</li>
<li>Doesn't improve within a few days</li>
</ul>
Also seek medical care if you notice signs or symptoms of an infection. These include:
<ul>
<li>Increasing pain and tenderness</li>
<li>Increasing swelling</li>
<li>Yellow drainage (pus) from an open blister</li>
<li>Red streaks leading away from the open blister</li>
</ul>
</div>

    <h2>Causes</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Sunburns are caused by exposure to too much ultraviolet (UV) light. UV radiation is a wavelength of sunlight in a
 range too short for the human eye to see. Ultraviolet A (UVA) is the type of solar radiation most associated 
 with skin aging (photoaging). Ultraviolet B (UVB) is associated with sunburn. Exposure to both types of 
 radiation is associated with developing skin cancer. Sunlamps and tanning beds also produce UV light and 
 can cause sunburn.
<br><br>
Melanin is the dark pigment in the outer layer of skin (epidermis) that gives your skin its normal color. When 
you're exposed to UV light, your body protects itself by accelerating the production of melanin. The extra 
melanin creates the darker color of a tan.
<br><br>
A suntan is your body's way of blocking the UV rays to prevent sunburn and other skin damage. But the protection
 only goes so far. The amount of melanin you produce is determined genetically. Many people simply don't produce 
 enough melanin to protect the skin well. Eventually, UV light causes the skin to burn, bringing pain, redness 
 and swelling.
<br><br>
You can get sunburn on cool, hazy or cloudy days. As much as 80 percent of UV rays pass through clouds. Snow, 
sand, water and other surfaces can reflect UV rays, burning your skin as severely as direct sunlight.

   <h2>Risk factors</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Risk factors for sunburn include:
<ul>
<li>Having light skin, blue eyes, and red or blond hair</li>
<li>Living or vacationing somewhere sunny, warm or at high altitude</li>
<li>Working outdoors</li>
<li>Mixing outdoor recreation and drinking alcohol</li>
<li>Having a history of sunburn</li>
<li>Regularly exposing unprotected skin to UV light from sunlight or artificial sources, such as tanning beds</li>
<li>Taking a drug that makes you more likely to burn (photosensitizing medications)</li>
</ul>

   <h2>Complications</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Intense, repeated sun exposure that results in sunburn increases your risk of other skin damage and certain 
diseases. These include premature aging of your skin (photoaging) and skin cancer.

<h3>1.Premature aging of your skin</h3>
<p>
Sun exposure and repeated sunburns accelerate the skin's aging process, making you look older than you are. 
Skin changes caused by UV light are called photoaging. The results of photoaging include:
<ul>
<li>Weakening of connective tissues, which reduces the skin's strength and elasticity</li>
<li>Deep wrinkles</li>
<li>Dry, rough skin</li>
<li>Fine red veins on your cheeks, nose and ears</li>
<li>Freckles, mostly on your face and shoulders</li>
<li>Dark or discolored spots (macules) on your face, back of hands, arms, chest and upper back — 
also called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neze)</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>2.Precancerous skin lesions</h3>
<p>
Precancerous skin lesions appear as rough, scaly patches in areas that have been damaged by the sun. They may be 
whitish, pink, tan or brown. They're usually found on the sun-exposed areas of the head, face, neck and hands 
of light-skinned people. These patches can evolve into skin cancer. They're also called actinic keratoses 
(ak-TIN-ik ker-uh-TOE-seez) and solar keratoses.
</p>

<h3>3.Skin cancer</h3>
<p>
Excessive sun exposure, even without sunburn, increases your risk of skin cancer, such as melanoma. It can 
damage the DNA of skin cells. Sunburns in childhood and adolescence may increase your risk of developing melanoma 
later in life.
<br><br>
Skin cancer develops mainly on areas of the body most exposed to sunlight, including the scalp, face, lips, ears,
 neck, chest, arms, hands and legs. Skin cancer on the leg is more common in women than in men.
<br><br>
Some types of skin cancer appear as a small growth or a sore that bleeds easily, crusts over, heals and then 
reopens. With melanoma, an existing mole may change or a new, suspicious-looking mole may develop. A type of
 melanoma called lentigo maligna develops in areas of long-term sun exposure. It starts as a tan flat spot that 
 slowly darkens and enlarges.
<br><br>
See your doctor if you notice a new skin growth, a bothersome change in your skin, a change in the appearance or 
texture of a mole, or a sore that doesn't heal.
</p>

<h3>4.Eye damage</h3>
<p>
The sun can also burn your eyes. Too much UV light damages the retina, lens or cornea. Sun damage to the lens 
can lead to clouding of the lens (cataracts). Sunburned eyes may feel painful or gritty. Sunburn of the cornea
 is also called snow blindness.

   <h2>Prevention</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Use these methods to prevent sunburn, even on cool, cloudy or hazy days. And be extra careful around water, 
snow and sand because they reflect the sun's rays. In addition, UV light is more intense at high altitudes.
<ul>
<li><b>Avoid sun exposure between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.</b>The sun's rays are strongest during these hours, 
so try to schedule outdoor activities for other times. If you can't do that, limit the length of time you're 
in the sun. Seek shade when possible.</li>
<li><b>Avoid sun tanning and tanning beds.</b>Using tanning beds to obtain a base tan doesn't decrease 
your risk of sunburn.</li>
<li><b>Cover up.</b>When outside, wear a wide-brimmed hat and clothing that covers you, including your arms and 
legs. Dark colors offer more protection, as do tightly woven fabrics. Consider using outdoor gear specially
 designed to provide sun protection. Check the label for its ultraviolet protection factor (UPF), which indicates
 how effectively a fabric blocks damaging sunlight. The higher the number, the better.</li>
<li><b>Use sunscreen frequently and generously.</b>No matter what your skin type is, use a sunscreen with an SPF 
of 15 or greater and broad-spectrum protection against UVA and UVB rays. The American Academy of Dermatology 
recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or greater.
<br><br>
About 15 to 30 minutes before going outdoors, apply sunscreen generously on skin that won't be protected by 
clothing. Reapply it every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or sweating. If you're also using 
insect repellent, apply the sunscreen first. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend 
products that combine an insect repellent with a sunscreen.
<br><br>
You may use sunscreen on toddlers and babies 6 months or older. The best products for them are those that 
contain physical blockers (titanium oxide, zinc oxide). For babies under 6 months, the American Academy of 
Pediatrics recommends using other forms of sun protection, such as shade or clothing.</li>
<li><b>Wear sunglasses when outdoors.</b>Choose sunglasses with UVA and UVB protection. Check the UV 
rating on the label when buying new glasses. Darker lenses are not necessarily better at blocking UV rays. 
It also helps to wear sunglasses that fit close to your face and have wraparound frames that block sunlight
 from all angles.</li>
<li><b>Be aware of medications that increase your sensitivity to the sun.</b>Common drugs that make you more
 sensitive to sunlight include antihistamines, ibuprofen, certain antibiotics, antidepressants, antipsychotics 
 and some cholesterol-lowering drugs. Talk with your pharmacist about your medication side effects.</li>
</ul>

   <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Your doctor is likely to conduct a physical exam and ask questions about your symptoms, UV exposure and sunburn 
history.
<br><br>
If you develop a sunburn or skin reaction after relatively minor exposures to sunlight, your doctor may recommend
 phototesting. During phototesting, small areas of your skin are exposed to measured amounts of UVA and UVB light 
 to try to reproduce the problem. If your skin reacts to the UV radiation, you're considered sensitive to sunlight 
 (photosensitive).
</div>
</div>

   <h2>Treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
If you've been sunburned, it may take two days for the severity of your burn to become evident, and several more
 days for your skin to begin to heal. Sunburn treatment doesn't heal your skin, but it can reduce pain, swelling 
 and discomfort. If at-home care doesn't help or your sunburn is very severe, your doctor may offer treatment to 
 help ease your pain or prevent infection.
</div>
</div>

   <h2>Lifestyle and home remedies</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Once sunburn occurs, you can't do much to limit damage to your skin. But the following tips may reduce your
 pain and discomfort:
 
 <ul>
<li><b>Take a pain reliever.</b>If needed, an over-the-counter pain reliever such as <b>ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, 
others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve)</b> may help control the pain and swelling of sunburn, especially if you take 
it soon after sun exposure. Some types of pain relievers may be applied to your skin as gels.</li>
<li><b>Cool the skin.</b>Apply to the affected skin a compress — such as a towel dampened with cool tap water. Or 
take a cool bath or shower.</li>
<li><b>Apply moisturizer.</b>An aloe vera lotion or gel may be soothing.</li>
<li><b>Don't break small blisters (no bigger than your little fingernail).</b>If a blister breaks, gently clean 
the area with mild soap and water, apply an antibiotic ointment, and cover it with a nonstick gauze bandage.</li>
<li><b>Treat peeling skin gently.</b>Within a few days, the affected area may begin to peel. This is your body's 
way of getting rid of the top layer of damaged skin. While your skin is peeling, continue to moisturize.</li>
<li><b>Protect your sunburn from further sun exposure.</b>Stay out of the sun or protect yourself from sunlight 
when you go outside.</li>
<li><b>Avoid applying "-caine" products, such as benzocaine.</b>Such creams may irritate the skin or cause an 
allergic reaction. Benzocaine has been linked to a rare but potentially deadly condition that decreases the amount
 of oxygen that the blood can carry (methemoglobinemia).</li>
</ul>
 <br><br>
 Don't use benzocaine in children younger than age 2 without supervision from a health care professional. 
 If you're an adult, never use more than the recommended dose and consider talking with your doctor before using it.
