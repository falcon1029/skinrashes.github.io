        <h2>What are Boils (Furunculosis)?</h2>
Boils (furuncles) are painful pus-filled bumps on the skin resulting from the deep 
infection of a hair follicle. The infection is usually caused by a type of bacteria 
called Staphylococcus aureus ("staph"). Many people are "carriers" of the staph germ, 
meaning that it normally lives on their skin or in their nose without doing them any
 harm. Tiny breaks in the surface of the skin (such as those caused by friction or 
 scratching), however, can help the germ gain entry into and infect the hair follicle,
 resulting in a boil.
<br><br>
Boils may resolve with simple self-care measures, but the infected fluid (pus) needs
 to drain in order for them to heal completely. Many boils drain of their own accord,
 or they can be lanced by a health care professional. Antibiotics may also be prescribed.
 Untreated boils can enlarge or grow together to form a giant multi-headed boil (carbuncle).
 Rarely, the infection in the skin can get into the bloodstream, leading to serious illness.

      <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Boils are most common in teenagers and young adults.
<br><br>
People that are particularly prone to developing boils include:

<ul>
<li>Athletes participating in contact sports or using shared equipment.</li>
<li>Individuals with a weakened immune system, such as persons with HIV, diabetics,
 and those taking certain medications such as the types of medications used to prevent 
 rejection of a transplanted organ or to treat cancer (chemotherapy).</li>
<li>Individuals with another skin condition that may lead to scratching or other 
injury to the skin (eczema, scabies).</li>
<li>Staph carriers.</li>
<li>People who are obese.</li>
<li>Individuals with poor nutrition.</li>
<li>People living in close quarters with others (military barracks, prison, homeless shelters).</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Causes of boils and carbuncles</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Boils and carbuncles are often caused by a type of bacteria called Staphylococcus 
aureus (staph bacteria) that infects one or more hair follicles. Staph bacteria 
usually live harmlessly on the surface of the skin or in the lining of the nose.
<br><br>
You can get a boil when bacteria enter the skin through cuts and grazes. Your 
immune system responds by sending infection-fighting white blood cells to kill 
the bacteria.
<br><br>
Over time, a mixture of dead bacteria, dead white blood cells and dead skin cells 
builds up inside the boil to form pus.
<br><br>
A carbuncle develops when the infection spreads further beneath the skin to 
create a cluster of boils.

      <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
A red-to-purple, tender lump on an area of the skin that also has hair. The most common 
areas for boils to occur are places where there is friction and/or places that tend to 
be sweaty, such as the buttocks, armpits, groin, neck, shoulders, and face. The skin 
surrounding the lump may look swollen and red. The center of the lump eventually becomes 
filled with yellow or white pus that you will be able to see (called "coming to a head"). 
The pus is a mixture of bacteria and infection-fighting white blood cells.

      <h2>Complications of boils and carbuncles</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Although most boils and carbuncles don't cause further problems, some people develop
 a secondary infection.
 <br><br>
This can range from a relatively minor (though often very painful) infection of the 
deeper layer of the skin, such as cellulitis, to rarer and more serious complications,
 such as sepsis.
 <br><br>
Larger boils and carbuncles can also lead to scarring.

      <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Warm compresses applied to the area for 20 minutes at least 3–4 times a day may ease 
the discomfort and help encourage the boil to drain. If the boil starts to drain, 
wash the area with antibacterial soap and apply some triple antibiotic ointment 
and a loose bandage. Repeat this process of cleansing and bandaging the area 2–3 
times a day until the skin is healed.
<br><br>
Boils can be very contagious. Do not share clothing, towels, bedding, or sporting 
equipment with others while you have a boil. Wash your hands frequently with antibacterial 
hand soap to avoid spreading the infection to others.
<br><br>
Use an antibacterial soap on boil-prone areas when showering, and dry your skin thoroughly 
after bathing. Avoid tight-fitting clothing and activities that cause a great deal of sweating.
<br><br>
Do not pop the boil yourself with a pin or needle. Doing so may make the infection worse.

      <h2>Preventing boils and carbuncles</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
You can't always avoid getting a boil or carbuncle, but these simple steps can reduce your risk:
<ul>
<li>wash your skin regularly using a mild antibacterial soap</li>
<li>carefully clean any cuts, wounds or grazes (even small ones) </li>
<li>cover cuts, wounds and grazes with a sterile bandage until they heal</li>
<li>eat healthily and exercise regularly to boost your immune system</li>
</ul>

      <h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
See your doctor if:
<ul>
<li>You have multiple boils or if the boil(s) increases in size or number.</li>
<li>You have a fever or chills, severe pain, or otherwise feel unwell.</li>
<li>The boil fails to drain.</li>
<li>The area of redness surrounding the boil begins spreading.</li>
<li>You have diabetes, a heart murmur, a problem with your immune system, or are 
taking immune-suppressing medications when you develop a boil.</li>
<li>You have had repeated outbreaks of boils.</li>
</ul>

If you are currently being treated for a skin infection that has not improved 
after 2–3 days of antibiotics, return to your doctor.

Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is a 
strain of staph bacteria resistant to antibiotics in the penicillin family, which
 have been the cornerstone of antibiotic therapy for staph and skin infections 
 for decades. CA-MRSA previously infected only small segments of the population, 
 such as health care workers and persons using injection drugs. However, CA-MRSA 
 is now a common cause of skin infections in the general population. While CA-MRSA 
 bacteria are resistant to penicillin and penicillin-related antibiotics, most staph 
 infections with CA-MRSA can be easily treated by health care practitioners using 
 local skin care and commonly available non-penicillin-family antibiotics. Rarely, 
 CA-MRSA can cause serious skin and soft tissue (deeper) infections. Staph infections 
 typically start as small red bumps or pus-filled bumps, which can rapidly turn into 
 deep, painful sores. If you see a red bump or pus-filled bump on the skin that is 
 worsening or showing any signs of infection (ie, the area becomes increasingly painful, 
 red, or swollen), see your doctor right away. Many people believe incorrectly that 
 these bumps are the result of a spider bite. Your doctor may need to test (culture) 
 infected skin for MRSA before starting antibiotics. If you have a skin problem that
 resembles a CA-MRSA infection or a culture that is positive for MRSA, your doctor
 may need to provide local skin care and prescribe oral antibiotics. To prevent 
 spread of infection to others, infected wounds, hands, and other exposed body 
 areas should be kept clean, and wounds should be covered during therapy.

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The pus inside of a boil needs to be drained thoroughly before the body can 
completely clear the infection. If the boil does not drain itself, your doctor 
may wish to perform a simple procedure. In this procedure, a sterile needle or 
small blade is used to "nick" the skin over the top of the boil, and the pus is 
allowed to drain out. The area will then be cleaned and bandaged, and you will 
be sent home with instructions to wash, apply antibacterial ointment, and re-bandage
 the area several times daily as discussed above. You may also be prescribed a 
 course of antibiotics to be taken by mouth.
<br><br>
Your physician may choose to collect a swab of the pus for laboratory analysis and 
swabs from other areas of the body (nose, armpits, and/or anus and genital area) to
 determine if you are a carrier of staph. If you are a carrier, your doctor may 
 prescribe a topical medication applied to the inside of the nose and/or oral 
 antibiotics for several days. These measures can help prevent a recurrence of 
 the boil(s) and decrease the possibility that you may unknowingly spread the 
 germ to others. If your doctor prescribes antibiotics, be sure to take the full 
 course of treatment to avoid the development of bacterial resistance to the 
 antibiotic.
