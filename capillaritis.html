        <h2>What is Capillaritis?</h2>
Capillaritis is characterized by leakage of red blood cells from small, superficial 
blood vessels that results in pinpoint-like hemorrhages (petechiae). Capillaritis 
is frequently found in patients with long periods of extended standing related to 
their occupations. A skin hypersensitivity reaction, salicylates and nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly associated origins of capillaritis, 
though the precise cause is unclear. Capillaritis is usually a life-long condition,
 flaring intermittently.

Capillaritis is seen more frequently in adults, but it does occur in older
 children and adolescents.

      <h2>Causes</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The etiology of capillaritis is still idiopatic, but for some reason it could happen 
due to capillaries that become inflamed and cause the capillary wall to rupture; 
leakage of red blood cells (erythrocytes) then occurs to the superficial areas 
of the body like the skin. Here are subsequent factors that could contribute to 
the occurrence of capillaritis:

<ul>
<li>Allergic reactions to certain food, materials (rubber or latex), medications 
and even to the environment</li>
<li>Work that needs prolong standing like nurses are also at risk of pigment purpura</li>
<li>Excessive and vigorous exercise on a warm weather</li>
<li>Viral infection</li>
<li>Using certain medication such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications
 like aspirin, Tylenol, or ibuprofen.</li>
 <li>Having a skin hypersensitivity reaction.</li>
 <li>Inflammation of the superficial capillaries just beneath your skin.</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The most common location for capillaritis is the leg, though it may manifest 
on the trunk and upper extremities. Capillaritis never presents on the face. 
Presentation may include:

<ul>
<li>Brown-red or deeply pigmented, pepper-like petechiae in dark-skinned individuals</li>
<li>Cayenne-pepperâ€“colored petechiae in lighter-skinned individuals</li>
<li>Color variations in the lesions due to different stages of blood breakdown 
product (hemosiderin) reabsorption</li>
</ul>

      <h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Though capillaritis is a benign condition, another condition may be at work. 
The evaluation of a primary care physician or dermatologist should be obtained 
when unsure of the nature of a rash.
