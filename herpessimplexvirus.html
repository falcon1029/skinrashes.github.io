        <h2>What is Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)?</h2>


<p>
The herpes simplex virus, also known as HSV, is an infection that causes herpes. 
Herpes can appear in various parts of the body, most commonly on the genitals or 
mouth. There are two types of the herpes simplex virus.

<ol>
<li><b>HSV-1:</b>Also known as oral herpes, this type can cause cold sores and 
fever blisters around the mouth and on the face.</li>
<li><b>HSV-2:</b>This type is generally responsible for genital herpes outbreaks.</li>
</ol>

     <h2>Causes of herpes simplex</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<p>
The herpes simplex virus is a contagious virus that can be passed from person to 
person through direct contact. Children will often contract HSV-1 from early contact
 with an infected adult. They then carry the virus with them for the rest of their lives.
</p>

<h3>HSV-1</h3>

<p>
Infection with HSV-1 can happen from general interactions such as:
<ul>
<li>eating from the same utensils</li>
<li>sharing lip balm</li>
<li>kissing</li>
</ul>
The virus spreads more quickly when an infected person is experiencing an outbreak. 
Anywhere from 30 to 95 percent of adults are seropositive for HSV-1, though they may 
never experience an outbreak. It’s also possible to get genital herpes from HSV-1 if 
someone who performed oral sex had cold sores during that time.
</p>

<h3>HSV-2</h3>

<p>
HSV-2 is contracted through forms of sexual contact with a person who has HSV-2. 
It is estimated that around 20 percent of sexually active adults in the United States 
are infected with HSV-2, according to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). 
While HSV-2 infections are spread through contact with a herpes sore, the AAD reports 
that most people get HSV-1 from an infected person who is asymptomatic, or does not 
have sores.

     <h2>Who is at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Anyone can be infected with HSV, regardless of age. Your risk is based almost 
entirely on exposure to the infection.
<br><br>
In cases of sexually transmitted HSV, people are more at risk when they participate 
in risky sexual behavior without the use of protection, such as condoms. Other 
risk factors for HSV-2 include:
<ul>
<li>having multiple sex partners</li>
<li>having sex at a younger age</li>
<li>being female</li>
<li>having another sexually transmitted infection (STI)</li>
<li>having a weakened immune system</li>
</ul>
If a pregnant woman is having an outbreak of genital herpes at the time of 
childbirth, it can expose the baby to both types of HSV, and may put them at 
risk for serious complications.

     <h2>Signs of herpes simplex</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
It is important to understand that someone may not have visible sores or 
symptoms and still be infected by the virus. And they may transmit the virus to others.
<br><br>
Some of the symptoms associated with this virus include:
<br><br>

<ul>
<li>blistering sores (in the mouth or on the genitals)</li>
<li>pain during urination (genital herpes)</li>
<li>itching</li>
</ul>
You may also experience symptoms that are similar to the flu. These symptoms can include:
<ul>
<li>fever</li>
<li>swollen lymph nodes</li>
<li>headaches</li>
<li>tiredness</li>
<li>lack of appetite</li>
</ul>

HSV can also spread to the eyes, causing a condition called herpes keratitis. 
This can cause symptoms such as eye pain, discharge, and a gritty feeling in the eye.

     <h2>Herpes simplex Diagnosis</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
This type of virus is generally diagnosed with a physical exam. Your doctor may 
check your body for sores and ask you about some of your symptoms. Your doctor 
may also request HSV testing. This is known as a herpes culture. It will confirm 
the diagnosis if you have sores on your genitals. During this test, your doctor 
will take a swab sample of fluid from the sore and then send it to a laboratory
 for testing.
<br><br>
Blood tests looking for antibodies to HSV-1 and HSV-2 can also help diagnose 
these infections. This is especially helpful when there are no sores present.

     <h2>Herpes simplex treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
There is currently no cure for this virus. Treatment focuses on getting rid
 of sores and limiting outbreaks.
<br><br>
It is possible that your sores will disappear without treatment. However, your 
doctor may determine you need one or more of the following medications:

<ul>
<li><b>acyclovir</b></li>
<li><b>famciclovir</b></li>
<li><b>valacyclovir</b></li>
</ul>
These medications can help infected individuals reduce the risk of spreading 
the virus to others. The medications also help to lower the intensity and 
frequency of outbreaks. These medications may come in oral (pill) form, or 
may be applied as a cream. For severe outbreaks, these medications may also
 be administered by injection.

     <h2>Long-term outlook for herpes simplex</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
People who become infected with HSV will have the virus for the rest of 
their lives. Even if it does not manifest symptoms, the virus will continue 
to live in an infected person’s nerve cells. Some people may experience 
regular outbreaks. Others will only experience one outbreak after they have
 been infected and then the virus may become dormant. Even if a virus is dormant,
 certain stimuli can trigger an outbreak. These include:

<ul>
<li>stress</li>
<li>menstrual periods</li>
<li>fever or illness</li>
<li>sun exposure or sunburn</li>
</ul>
It is believed that outbreaks may become less intense over time because 
the body starts creating antibodies. If a generally healthy individual is 
infected with the virus, there are usually no complications.

     <h2>Preventing the spread of herpes simplex infections</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Although there is no cure for herpes, you can take measures to avoid 
becoming infected, or to prevent spreading HSV to another person.
<br><br>
If you are experiencing an outbreak of HSV-1, some preventative steps 
to take include:

<ul>
<li>Try to avoid direct physical contact with other people.</li>
<li>Don’t share any items that can pass the virus around, such as 
cups, towels, silverware, clothing, makeup, or lip balm.</li>
<li>Don’t participate in oral sex, kissing, or any other type 
of sexual activity during an outbreak.</li>
<li>Wash your hands thoroughly and apply medication with cotton 
swabs to reduce contact with sores.</li>
</ul>
Individuals with HSV-2 should avoid any type of sexual activity with 
other people during an outbreak. If the individual is not experiencing 
symptoms but has been diagnosed with the virus, a condom should be used 
during intercourse. But even when using a condom, the virus can still be 
passed to a partner from uncovered skin. Women who are pregnant and infected 
may have to take medicine to prevent the virus from infecting their unborn babies.
