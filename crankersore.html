        <h2>What are Canker Sores?</h2>

<p>
Canker sores (aphthous ulcers), or aphthae, are the most common cause of 
periodic (recurring) ulcers inside the mouth and genital linings (mucous membrane surfaces). 
Their cause is unknown, but stress, lack of sleep, trauma, and perhaps some 
vitamin deficiencies, toothpastes, and foods can make the condition worse. 
Some people with anemia and other medical conditions that weaken the immune 
system may be more likely to develop canker sores.
<br><br>
There are 3 types of canker sore:

<ul>
<li>Minor aphthae (80% of cases)</li>
<li>Major aphthae (Sutton disease, approximately 10% of cases)</li>
<li>Herpetiform aphthae (10% of cases)</li>
</ul>

Minor aphthae heal within 1–2 weeks.
<br><br>
Major aphthae are extremely painful, last from 2–4 weeks, and generally 
cause scars after they heal.
<br><br>
Herpetiform aphthae progress in a way that is similar to minor aphthous ulcers.

      <h2>Causes and risk factors</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Canker sores affect approximately 25% of the general population. They are 
more common in women, and they usually start to appear in children or teens.
<br><br>
People infected with HIV/AIDS are often severely affected with canker sores.

Your risk for developing canker sores increases if you have a family history 
of canker sores. Canker sores have various causes, and the most common ones include:

<ul>
<li>viral infection</li>
<li>stress</li>
<li>hormonal fluctuation</li>
<li>food allergy</li>
<li>menstrual cycle</li>
<li>vitamin or mineral deficiency</li>
<li>immune system problem</li>
<li>mouth injury</li>
</ul>

A deficiency in certain vitamins, such as B-3 (niacin), B-9 (folic acid), or B-12 
(cobalamin), can make you more prone to getting canker sores. Zinc, iron, or calcium 
deficiencies can also trigger or worsen canker sores.
<br><br>
In some cases, the cause of a canker sore can’t be determined.
