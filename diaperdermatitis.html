        <h2>What is Diaper Dermatitis (Candidiasis)?</h2>


<p>
<b>Candida albicans </b>is a type of fungus normally found in the digestive (gastrointestinal) 
tract. If your baby is wearing a moist or blocked up (occluded) diaper, particularly one 
that is dirty (has fecal contamination), an inflammatory skin rash (dermatitis) may develop
 on the baby's skin. Diarrhea increases the risk for developing candidal diaper dermatitis,
 and candida infection in the mouth (oral thrush) may also occur.

    <div class="container">
Diaper dermatitis is one of the most common skin conditions in infants and children. 
Candidal diaper dermatitis is the second most common type of diaper dermatitis, with 
noninfected areas of redness and tenderness (irritant diaper dermatitis) being the most 
common type.

      <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<ul>
<li>Candidal diaper dermatitis most commonly appears in the genitals and diaper area, 
particularly the deep folds, and it consists of red elevated areas (papules) and flat, 
solid areas of skin (plaques) with sharp edges and skin flakes (scale) as well as 
surrounding "satellite" skin elevations containing pus (pustules).</li>
<li>Redness (erythema) may appear to be joined into one area (confluent).</li>
<li>Breakdown (erosions) or loss of the upper layer of skin may be present.</li>
<li>Alternatively, the lesions may be merging together (coalescing) small pink 
bumps with overlying scale, without any redness.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="container">
<ul>
<li>Keep the diaper open as much as possible while the infant sleeps to allow drying of the skin.</li>
<li>Use barrier ointments such as zinc oxide paste or petrolatum (VaselineÂ®) with diaper changes.</li>
<li>Gently cleanse the diaper area with plain water or mild soap.</li>
<li>Be sure to change your baby's diapers, using disposable diapers.</li>

      <h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
See your baby's doctor or a dermatologist for evaluation if your baby's diaper dermatitis does 
not improve with self-care measures.

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Topical therapies, applied twice a day:
<ul>
<li>Nystatin cream</li>
<li>Econazole cream</li>
<li>Miconazole cream</li>
<li>Clotrimazole cream</li>
</ul>
The doctor may also reassure you that once your baby is toilet trained, the 
diaper dermatitis will no longer develop.
