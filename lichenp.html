<h2>What is lichen planus?</h2>

<p>
    Lichen planus is a fairly common, itchy, non-infectious type of rash that usually occurs in adults.
    Doctors use the word ‘lichen’ to mean small bumps on the skin. ‘Planus’ means ‘flat’, and tells us that
    the small itchy bumps that make up the rash of lichen planus have shiny flat tops.

     <h2>What causes lichen planus?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<p>
    The cause of lichen planus is still not known, but is likely to have something to do with the body’s
    defences – the immune system. Rashes that look like lichen planus – known as ‘lichenoid drug eruptions’ –
    are sometimes a reaction to taking medicines such as gold (used for arthritis) or antimalarial tablets.
    Lichen planus is not contagious.

<h3>Is lichen planus hereditary?</h3>
<p>
    Usually it is not but, rarely, a few members of the same family can have it.
</p>

<h3>What are the symptoms of lichen planus?</h3>
<p>
    Lichen planus on the skin is usually itchy.

     <h2>What does lichen planus look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The rash is made up of clusters of shiny, slightly raised purple-red spots
    (papules), usually measuring 3-5mm in diameter. A close look may show fine
    white streaks on their surface. The rash usually affects the fronts of the wrists,
    around the ankles and on the lower back, but can spread more widely. Lichen
    planus can also come up in lines where the skin has been scratched or
    injured (this is called Koebner’s response).<br><br>
    Other types of lichen planus include:

    <ul>
    <li>Thickened ('hypertrophic') lichen planus, which tends to affect the
        shins.</li>
    <li>Ring-shaped ('annular') lichen planus, which tends to affect the creases
        such as the armpits. </li>
    <li>Lichen planus of the scalp can cause patches of hair loss which do not
        usually re-grow.</li>
    <li>The nails can be affected, with thinning of the nail plate, or the nails
        becoming rough and grooved.</li>
    <li>Lichen planus often affects the inside of the cheeks and the gums, and
        this can be seen in about 50% of people who have it on the skin (see
        Patient Information Leaflet on Oral Lichen Planus).</li>
    <li>Lichen planus can affect the penis in men, causing purple or white ringshaped
        (annular) patches. Unlike lichen planus on other body parts,
        they often do not itch. </li>
    <li>Lichen planus can affect the genital area in women too, but this is rare.</li>
    <li>In some patients oval grey-brown marks appear on the face and neck
        or trunk and limbs without a preceding rash. This is called Lichen
        planus pigmentosa.</li>
    <li>Blistering (bullous) lichen planus is rare and usually affects the lower
        legs.</li>
</ul>
    <br><br>

    Lichen planus is common in the mouth and is present in about 30-70% of those who have it on their skin (see patient
    information leaflet for Oral Lichen Planus).
	<br><br>

    Lichen planus can affect the penis in men, causing purple-coloured or white ring-shaped patches. Unlike other patches
    of lichen planus, these often do not itch. Lichen planus can affect the genital area in women too, but this is less common.
    <br><br>
    Most patients with lichen planus clear up within 18 months and usually stay clear, although some have a second episode
    many years later. Unfortunately some types of lichen planus, such as oral, hair or nail involvement, can last for many
    years. Even after the active lichen planus has cleared up, pigmented stains in the skin may persist for a long time,
    particularly in Asian or Afro-Caribbean skin.

     <h2>How will lichen planus be diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Usually the diagnosis of lichen planus can be made easily enough just by the look of the rash. Confusion may arise with
    flat ‘plane’ warts, with some types of eczema, and with rashes due to some drugs. If there is real doubt, the diagnosis
    can be clinched by looking under the microscope at a small sample of skin (a biopsy specimen) removed after a local
    anaesthetic injection.


<h3>Can lichen planus be cured?</h3>
<p>
    No, treatment damps it down but does not switch it off. However, lichen planus usually goes away by itself.

     <h2>How can lichen planus be treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Mild lichen planus without irritation does not need any treatment
    <ul>
    <li><b>Moderate lichen planus of the skin: </b>Affected areas are usually treated with
        steroid creams or ointments. Strong (potent) steroids are usually needed to
        calm the itchiness of the rash. These should be applied carefully once or twice
        a day, as instructed by your medical advisor. As the rash and itch clear, the
        red-purple spots change to grey-brown flat marks. At this stage, the skin no
        longer requires treatment with a steroid (doing so will raise the risk of side
        effects such as thinning of the skin). These marks will slowly fade with time.
        The non-steroid prescription-only medication tacrolimus ointment and
        pimecrolimus cream may also be helpful for lichen planus, especially on the
        face and delicate areas as they do not carry any risk of causing skin thinning. </li>
    <li><b>Severe or widespread of lichen planus. </b>For severe or widespread lichen
        planus, your doctor may suggest treatment with a course of steroid tablets or
        ultra violet (UV) therapy with narrow band UVB or psoralen with UVA (PUVA).
        Other possible tablet treatments include Methotrexate, Acitretin and
        Hydroxychloroquine. These drugs were not developed to treat lichen planus (it
        is not in their product license), but there is some evidence that they may be
        helpful. They do not cure the rash and it is likely to worsen if they are stopped
        prematurely. Treatment must be carefully monitored with blood tests and like
        any medicine, the risks of harmful effects versus benefits need careful
        consideration. </li>
