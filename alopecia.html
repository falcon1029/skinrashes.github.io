        <h2>What is Alopecia Areata?</h2>
    Alopecia is a general term for hair loss. Alopecia areata is a specific, common cause of hair loss that can occur at any age. It usually causes small,
    coin-sized, round patches of baldness on the scalp, although hair elsewhere such as the beard, eyebrows, eyelashes, body and limbs can be affected.
    Occasionally it can involve the whole scalp (alopecia totalis) or even the entire body and scalp (alopecia universalis). It is not possible to
    predict how much hair will be lost. Regrowth of hair in typical alopecia areata is usual over a period of months or sometimes years, but cannot
    be guaranteed. The hair sometimes regrows white, at least in the first instance. Further hair loss is not uncommon. In alopecia totalis and
    alopecia universalis, the likelihood of total regrowth is less.

       <h2>Causes of alopecia areata.</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Hair is lost because it is rejected by the affected personâ€™s immune system which does not recognise the hair roots (follicles) as "self",
    but regards them as "foreign" (autoimmunity). Why this happens is not fully understood, nor is it known why only localised areas are
    affected and why the hair regrows again.
    <br><br>

    Someone with alopecia areata is more likely than a person without it to develop other autoimmune conditions such as thyroid disease,
    diabetes and vitiligo (white patches on the skin), although the risk of getting these disorders is still low. Your doctor may suggest a
    blood test looking for antibodies that may predict whether you are likely to develop thyroid problems or pernicious anaemia.
    Alopecia areata is not catching nor is it related to diet or vitamin deficiencies. Stress, particularly events such as bereavement,
    separation and accidents,   occasionally appears to be a trigger for alopecia areata.

       <h2>Is alopecia areata hereditary?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    There is a genetic predisposition to alopecia areata and close family members may be affected. Thyroid problems or diabetes are also more common.

       <h2>What are the symptoms?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    There may be a tingling sensation in the scalp. It can be a very upsetting condition to the sufferer, especially if the bald area cannot be disguised by hairstyle.

    Typically, it starts as one or more bald, smooth patches on the scalp, which are not inflamed or scaly. It tends to affect the
    pigmented hair so there may be some white hairs left within the bald area in older people. Sometimes the hair loss is diffuse rather
    than well-circumscribed patches. Short, tapered hairs, known as exclamation mark hairs that are characteristic of alopecia areata,
    may be seen at the edge of the bald patch. Regrowth usually starts at the centre of the bald patch with fine white hair that thickens
    with time and usually regains its colour. Some people with alopecia areata develop small pits on their nails, similar to the dimples
    seen on a thimble.

      <h2>Can it be cured?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    No, alopecia areata cannot be cured. If the hair loss is patchy, there is a good chance (about 60-80%) that there will be complete
    regrowth within 1 year without treatment. There may, however, be further episodes of hair loss in the future. If there is very extensive
    hair loss from the start, the chances of it regrowing may not be as good. In people with Down's syndrome, or those who have severe
    eczema, the chances of regrowth are not so good either.

      <h2>Treatments for alopecia areata</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The most common form of alopecia areata treatment is the use of corticosteroids, powerful anti-inflammatory drugs that can
    suppress the immune system. These can be administered through local injections (most common), topical ointment application, or orally.
<br><br>
    Other medications that can be prescribed that either promote hair growth or affect the immune system include Minoxidil,
    Anthralin, SADBE, and DPCP. Although some of these may help with the re-growth of hair, they cannot prevent the formation
    of new bald patches. Some people turn to alternative treatment methods such as acupuncture and aromatherapy, although there
    is little, if any, evidence to support these treatments.<b>
    The use of photochemotherapy is supported by some studies and presents a potential alternative for patients
    unable or unwilling to use systemic or invasive therapies.</b>
	<br><br>

    In addition to its aesthetic aspect, hair affords a degree of protection against the elements.
    People with alopecia areata who miss the protective qualities of hair may wish to:
<ul>
    <li>Wear sunscreen if exposed to the sun</li>
    <li>Wear wraparound glasses to protect the eyes from the sun and debris which the eyebrows and eyelashes would normally defend against</li>
    <li>Use headwear such as hats, wigs, and scarves to protect the head from the sun or keep it warm</li>
    <li>Use ointment inside the nose to keep membranes moist and to protect against organisms that are normally trapped by nostril hair</li>
</ul>
Alopecia areata does not directly make people sick, nor is it contagious. It can, however, be difficult to adapt to emotionally.
For many people, alopecia areata is a traumatic disease that warrants treatment addressing the emotional aspect of hair loss, as well as the hair loss itself.
<br><br>
Support groups and counseling are available for people to share their thoughts and feelings, and to discuss common psychological
reactions to the condition.
<br><br>
Alopecia areata has been compared by some to vitiligo, an autoimmune skin disease where the body attacks melanin-producing cells,
leading to white patches. Research suggests that these two conditions may share a similar pathogenesis, with similar types of
immune cells and cytokines driving the diseases and common genetic risk factors.
