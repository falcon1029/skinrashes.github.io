        <h2>What is Cherry Hemangioma?</h2>
A cherry hemangioma is a small non-cancerous, red-purple bump on the skin 
that is typically seen in older adults. It is formed from an overgrowth 
of small veins.
<br><br>
Red moles, or cherry angiomas, are common skin growths that can develop 
on most areas of your body. They’re also known as senile angiomas or 
Campbell de Morgan spots.
<br><br>
They’re usually found on people aged 30 and older. The collection of small 
blood vessels inside a cherry angioma give them a reddish appearance.
<br><br>
This type of skin growth is typically not a cause for concern unless it bleeds 
often or changes in size, shape, or color. Talk to your doctor if you notice
 any bleeding or changes in appearance. These could be symptoms of skin cancer.

      <h2>What do they look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
A cherry angioma is often bright red, circular or oval in shape, and small — usually 
ranging in size from a pinpoint to about one-fourth of an inch in diameter. Some cherry
 angiomas appear smooth and even with your skin, while others appear slightly raised.
 They most often grow on the torso, arms, legs, and shoulders.
Bleeding can occur if the angioma is scratched, rubbed, or cut open.

    <div class="container">
Cherry hemangiomas are found in individuals of all races and ethnic backgrounds.
 They occur more frequently with increasing age.

      <h2>What causes cherry angiomas?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The exact cause of red moles is unknown, but there may be a genetic factor that 
makes certain people more likely to get them. They’ve also been linked to pregnancy, 
exposure to chemicals, certain medical conditions, and climate.
<br><br>
There also appears to be a link between cherry angiomas and age. They often begin 
to appear when individuals reach 30 years old and seem to increase in size and 
number with age. One study noted that over 75 percent of people over 75 years 
old have them.

      <h2>How are cherry angiomas treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
You probably won’t need to have a cherry angioma treated, but you do have options 
if you want it removed for cosmetic reasons.
You might need to have it removed if it’s in an area that is easily bumped, which 
can lead to regular bleeding.
There are a few common procedures for removing red moles.



<h3>Electrocauterization</h3>

<p>
This surgical method of treatment involves burning the angioma by using an electric 
current delivered by a tiny probe. For this procedure, you’ll also have a grounding 
pad placed somewhere on your body to ground the rest of your body from a surge of 
electricity.
</p>


<h3>Cryosurgery</h3>

<p>
Cryosurgery involves freezing the angioma with liquid nitrogen. The extreme cold will 
destroy it. This method is known for being a quick and relatively easy procedure.
<br><br>
You often only need one treatment session for cryosurgery to work, and the liquid 
nitrogen is usually sprayed for only about 10 seconds. The wound doesn’t require 
much care afterward.
</p>


<h3>Laser surgery</h3>

<p>
This type of surgery involves using a pulsed dye laser (PDL) to get rid of the cherry 
angioma. The PDL is a concentrated yellow laser that gives off enough heat to destroy 
the lesion. This method is quick and is done as an outpatient procedure, which means 
you won’t have to stay in the hospital overnight.
<br><br>
Depending on how many angiomas you have, you may need between one and three treatment 
sessions. This surgery can cause slight bruising, which can last up to 10 days.
</p>


<h3>Shave excision</h3>

<p>
This procedure involves removing the angioma from the top portion of skin. 
Shave excision is an alternative to invasive surgery that would involve cutting 
out the lesion or growth and using stitches, or sutures, to close the wound.
<br><br>
If you do have angiomas removed with any of these methods, scarring is uncommon but 
always possible.
