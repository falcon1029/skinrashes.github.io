      <h1>Atopic Dermatitis</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>What is Atopic Dermatitis?</h2>
Atopic dermatitis is a skin disease. When a person has this disease the skin 
becomes extremely itchy. Scratching leads to redness, swelling, cracking, 
weeping, clear fluid, crusting, and scaling. Often, the skin gets worse (flares),
and then it improves or clears up (remissions).<br><br>

Atopic dermatitis is the most common kind of eczema, a term that describes 
many kinds of skin problems.

 Atopic dermatitis is a common, often persistent skin disease that affects a 
 large percentage of the world's population. Atopy is a special type of 
 allergic hypersensitivity that is associated with asthma, inhalant 
 allergies (hay fever), and a chronic dermatitis. There is a known 
 hereditary component of the disease, and it is more common in affected
 families. Criteria that enable a doctor to diagnose it include the 
 typical appearance and distribution of the rash in a patient with a
 personal or family history of asthma and/or hay fever. The term atopic
 is from the Greek meaning "strange." The term dermatitis means 
 inflammation of the skin. Many physicians and patients use the term 
 eczema when they are referring to this condition. Sometimes 
 it is called neurodermatitis.<br><br>

 In atopic dermatitis, the skin becomes extremely itchy and inflamed, 
 causing redness, swelling, vesicle formation (minute blisters), cracking, 
 weeping, crusting, and scaling. This type of eruption is termed eczematous.
 In addition, dry skin is a very common complaint in almost 
 all those afflicted with atopic dermatitis.<br><br>

 Although atopic dermatitis can occur in any age, most often it affects 
 infants and young children. Occasionally, it may persist into adulthood 
 or may actually appear at that time. Some patients tend to have a protracted 
 course with ups and downs. In most cases, there are periods of time when the 
 disease is worse, called exacerbations or flares, which are followed by
 periods when the skin improves or clears up entirely, called remissions. 
 Many children with atopic dermatitis enter into a permanent remission 
 of the disease when they get older, although their skin may remain 
 somewhat dry and easily irritated.<br><br>

 Multiple factors can trigger or worsen atopic dermatitis, including low humidity, 
 seasonal allergies, exposure to harsh soaps and detergents, and cold weather.
 Environmental factors can activate symptoms of atopic dermatitis at any time
 in the lives of individuals who have inherited the atopic disease trait.

      <h2>Who gets Atopic dermatitis?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Atopic dermatitis is most common in babies and children. But it can happen 
to anyone. People who live in cities and dry climates may be more 
likely to get this disease.

      <h2>What are the symptoms?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The most common symptoms of atopic dermatitis are:

<ul>
<li>Dry and itchy skin.</li>
<li>Rashes on the face, inside the elbows, behind the knees, and on the 
hands and feet.</li>

</ul>
Scratching the skin can cause:
<ul>
    <li>Redness.</li>
    <li>Swelling.</li>
    <li>Cracking.</li>
    <li>Weeping, clear fluid.</li>
    <li>Crusting.</li>

      <h2>What causes it?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
No one knows what causes atopic dermatitis. It is probably passed down from your 
parents (genetics). Your environment can also trigger symptoms. Stress can make 
the condition worse, but it does not cause the disease.4

<div class="card">
    <div class="header">
      <h2>Can atopic dermatitis affect the face?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Yes. Atopic dermatitis may affect the skin around the eyes, the eyelids, the 
eyebrows, and lashes. Scratching and rubbing the eye area can cause the skin to 
change in appearance. Some people with atopic dermatitis develop an extra fold 
of skin under their eyes, called an atopic pleat or Dennie-Morgan fold. Other 
people may have hyperpigmented eyelids, meaning that the skin on their eyelids 
darkens from the inflammation or hay fever (allergic shiners). Patchy eyebrows 
and eyelashes may also result from scratching or rubbing.<br><br>

The face is very commonly affected in babies, who may drool excessively, and 
become irritated from skin contact with their abundant saliva.<br><br>

The skin of a person with atopic dermatitis loses excessive moisture from
 the epidermal layer. Some patients with atopic dermatitis lack a protein 
 called filaggrin that is important in retaining moisture. This defective 
 genetic trait allows the skin to become very dry, which reduces its 
 protective abilities. In addition, the skin is very susceptible to 
 infectious disorders, such as staphylococcal and streptococcal bacterial
 skin infections, warts, herpes simplex, and molluscum contagiosum
 (which is caused by a virus).<br><br>

      <h2>How is atopic dermatitis diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Currently, there is no single test to diagnose atopic dermatitis, but your doctor may:
<ul>
<li>Ask you about your medical history, including:

      <ul>
         <li>Your family history of allergies.</li>
         <li>Whether you also have diseases such as hay fever or asthma.</li>
         <li>Exposure to irritants, such as:
                <ul>
              <li>Wool or synthetic fibers.</li>
              <li>Soaps and detergents.</li>
              <li>Some perfumes and cosmetics.</li>
			  <li>Substances such as chlorine, mineral oil, or solvents.</li>
              <li>Dust or sand.</li>
              <li>Cigarette smoke.</li>
			  </ul>  </li>
			  

	    
         <li>Sleep problems.</li>
         <li>Foods that seem to be related to skin flares.</li>
		 <li>Previous treatments for skin-related symptoms.</li>
         <li>Use of steroids or other medications.</li>
         </ul>

         </li>

<li>Identify factors that may trigger flares of atopic dermatitis by pricking the 
skin with a needle that contains something that you might be allergic to (in small amounts).</li>
</ul>
Your doctor may need to see you several times to diagnose you. In some cases, your 
family doctor or pediatrician may refer you to a dermatologist (doctor specializing 
in skin disorders) or allergist (allergy specialist) for further evaluation.

      <h2>Living With Atopic dermatitis</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Besides medications, there are a number of things you can do to help 
control your atopic dermatitis.

<ul>
      <li>Skin care: Sticking with a daily skin care routine can prevent 
	  flares. Skin care should include:
	         <ul>
			       <li>Lukewarm baths to cleanse and moisturize the skin 
				   without drying it out.</li>
				   <li>Using mild bar soap or nonsoap cleanser.</li>
				   <li>Air-drying the skin after bathing, or gently patting it dry.</li>
				   <li>A moisturizer to seal in the water after bathing.
				   Use creams and ointments and avoid lotions with high 
				   water or alcohol content.</li>
				   <li>Protecting the skin from rough clothing, such as wool or 
				   man-made fibers.</li>
				   
			</ul>
	  
	  </li>
  
      <li>Stay away from things you are allergic to, such as:
	             <ul>
				 <li>Dust mites:
				       <ul>
					   <li>Put mattresses and pillows inside special dust-proof covers.</li>
					   <li>Wash sheets, blankets, and bed covers often using hot water.</li>
					   <li>Remove carpets.</li>
					   </ul>
				 </li>
				 <li>Molds.</li>
				 <li>Pollen.</li>
				 <li>Cat or dog dander.</li>
				 <li>Some perfumes and makeups.</li>
				 <li>Certain foods such as eggs, peanuts, milk, fish, 
				 soy products, or wheat. You should change your diet to avoid 
				 any foods you are allergic to.</li>
				 </ul>
	  
	  </li>
	  
	  <li>Stress management and relaxation techniques to 
	  decrease numbers of flares. Talking to family, 
	  friends, health professionals, and support groups can help.</li>
      <li>Prevent scratching or rubbing, which irritates the skin, increases swelling, 
	  and actually increases itchiness. Keep your child's fingernails short to
	  help reduce scratching.</li>
	  				   
 </ul>

Atopic dermatitis and vaccination against smallpox. People with atopic dermatitis 
should not get the smallpox vaccine. It may cause serious problems in people 
with atopic dermatitis.
