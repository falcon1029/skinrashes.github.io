        <h2>What is Erythema Infectiosum(Fifth Disease)?</h2>

<p>
Fifth disease (erythema infectiosum), also called slapped-cheek disease, is a 
common illness in young children due to infection with parvovirus B19. Fifth 
disease is spread by contact with others who are infected, specifically by 
exposure to fluid from the nose (respiratory secretions). The illness lasts 
approximately 5 days, but the rash may keep coming back for a few weeks, 
particularly with exercise, heat, fever, or stress. If a pregnant woman 
becomes infected, the infection can be harmful to the unborn baby. Fifth 
disease can also cause arthritis, although this is more commonly seen in 
infected adults.

      <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Fifth disease occurs all over the world. Lab studies show that about half 
of adults have been infected, although they may never remember being ill. 
<br><br>
Erythema infectiosum most commonly affects young children and often occurs 
in several members of the family or school class. Thirty percent of infected 
individuals have no symptoms.

      <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Mild prodromal symptoms begin approximately 1 week after exposure to PV-B19 
and last 2-3 days. They include the following:
<ul>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Sore throat</li>
<li>Pruritus</li>
<li>Coryza</li>
<li>Abdominal pain</li>
<li>Arthralgias</li>
</ul>
These symptoms precede a symptom-free period of about 7-10 days, after which 
the infection progresses through the following stages:

<ul>
<li><b>Phase 1 </b>- The exanthem begins with the classic slapped-cheek appearance, 
which typically fades over 2-4 days</li>
<li><b>Phase 2 </b>- This phase occurs 1-4 days later and is characterized by an erythematous 
maculopapular rash that fades into a classic lacelike reticular pattern as confluent 
areas clear</li>
<li><b>Phase 3 </b>- Frequent clearing and recurrences for weeks or occasionally months may occur due 
to stimuli such as exercise, irritation, stress, or overheating of the skin from sunlight 
or bathing in hot water</li>

</ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The diagnosis of erythema infectiosum usually is based on clinical presentation alone, 
and a workup for patients with the classic presentation is not necessary. For patients 
with other signs or symptoms associated with human parvovirus (PV) B19 or for exposure 
in a woman who is pregnant, confirmation of infection may be helpful and can be
 accomplished with the following specialized tests
 
 <ul>
<li>IgM assays - Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA)</li>
<li>Dot blot hybridization</li>
<li>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay</li>
<li>Loop-mediated isothermal amplification</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Background</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Erythema infectiosum (also known as fifth disease) is usually a benign childhood 
condition characterized by a classic slapped-cheek appearance and lacy exanthem.
It results from infection with human parvovirus (PV) B19, an erythrovirus. 
Human PV-B19 also is associated with other hematologic, rheumatologic, and neurologic 
conditions, including polyarthropathy, aplastic anemia, and hydrops fetalis. 
<br><br>
In erythema infectiosum, a classic 3-phased cutaneous eruption follows a rarely 
noticed prodrome (see the image below).

      <h2>Treatment of erythema infectiosum</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Erythema infectiosum is not generally a serious condition. There is no specific
 treatment. Affected children may remain at school, as the infectious stage or 
 viraemia occurs before the rash is evident.
 <ul>
<li>The application of an ice-cold flannel can relieve the discomfort of burning hot cheeks.</li>
<li>Red blood cell transfusions and immunoglobulin therapy can be successful in chronic 
parvovirus infection or during an aplastic crisis.</li>
<li>Hydrops fetalis due to parvovirus infection is treated by intrauterine transfusion.</li>
</ul>
</div>

      <h2>Complications of erythema infectiosum</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Although usually a mild childhood condition, erythrovirus B19 infection can 
result in complications. 
<br><br>
These include:
 
 <ul>
<li>Polyarthropathy in infected adults (painful, swollen joints)</li>
<li>Aplastic crisis or potentially dangerous low blood cell count in 
patients with haemolytic blood disorders such as autoimmune haemolytic anaemia 
and sickle cell disease</li>
<li>Spontaneous abortion, intrauterine death (9%) or hydrops fetalis in 3% of 
the offspring of infected pregnant women. This can occur if erythema infectiosum 
occurs in the first half of pregnancy. Parvovirus B19 does not cause congenital 
malformations. As the risk of an adverse outcome is low, the infection is not 
routinely screened for in pregnancy</li>
<li>Chronic parvovirus infection in immunodeficient patients, such as organ 
transplant recipients, causing erythropoietin-resistant anaemia, proteinuria,
 and glomerulosclerosis in a renal allograft</li>
<li>Rarely, encephalitis, hepatitis, non-occlusive bowel infarction, amegakaryocytic
 thrombocytopenia, myositis and heart disease</li>
</ul>
