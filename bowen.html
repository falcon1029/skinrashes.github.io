        <h2>What is Bowen's Disease?</h2>
    Bowen’s disease is also known as intraepidermal squamous cell carcinoma, and is a growth of cancerous cells that is confined to the
    outer layer of the skin. It is not a serious condition, and its importance rests on the fact that, occasionally, it can progress
    into an invasive skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma). For this reason, dermatologists usually treat, or at least keep an eye on,
    Bowen's disease.

      <h2>What causes Bowen’s disease?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Most cases of Bowen’s disease develop as a result of long-term sun exposure. Very occasionally,
    Bowen’s disease may be seen in the context of previous radiotherapy, following chronic arsenic ingestion
    (very rare nowadays) or on the genitalia in association with the virus that causes warts (the human papillomavirus).
    Bowen's disease is neither infectious, nor due to an allergy.

      <h2>Is it hereditary?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    No, it is not; but some of the factors that increase the risk of getting it, such as a fair skin and a tendency to
    burn in the sun, do run in families.
</div>

      <h2>What are its symptoms?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Usually Bowen's appears as reddened patches. Sometimes these are raised spots, or they may look like warts. Often the
    affected skin looks red and sore. Bowenoid papulosis usually occurs on the pubic or genital area in men and women.
    This appears as brown or dark brown patches. When Bowen's is found in the vulval area (the outside parts of a woman's
    genitals) or in the mouth, there can be white patches on the skin called leukoplakia.
     <br><br>
    A common symptom of Bowen's is itching. But often there are no symptoms apart from a patch on the skin. In some cases,
    the affected skin may become sore and bleed.

      <h2>What does it look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    A patch of Bowen’s disease starts as a small red scaly area, which grows very slowly. It may reach a diameter of a few centimetres across.
    It commonly occurs on sun-exposed skin, especially the head, hands and lower legs. More than one lesion may be present. The development of
    an ulcer or lump on a patch of Bowen’s disease may indicate the formation of invasive squamous cell carcinoma.

      <h2>How will it be diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    A patch of Bowen’s disease can look rather like other skin conditions, such as psoriasis. For this reason a biopsy may be needed to make the diagnosis.
</div>
</div>


<div class="card">
    <div class="header">
      <h2>Can it be cured?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Yes. As Bowen’s disease is confined to the surface of the skin, there are a variety of ways in which this can be achieved.
</div>
</div>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    There are a few treatments for Bowen's disease, such as:
<ul>
    <li>imiquimod cream</li>
    <li>chemotherapy creams which are put straight onto affected skin</li>
    <li>freezing with liquid nitrogen(Cryotherapy)</li>
    <li>surgery</li>
</ul>
    All these treatments can work well. The treatment you have will often depend on which part of your body is affected.
    Because there are many treatments, and because this is a very early type of skin cancer, the cure rates are high.



<h3>freezing with liquid nitrogen(Cryotherapy)</h3>
<p>
    It may be possible to treat the area by freezing it. This is called cryotherapy or cryosurgery. Liquid nitrogen
    is sprayed onto the affected area. At the time, this feels very cold and a bit uncomfortable. Afterwards, you will
    have a scab, which usually falls off within a few weeks. This removes the affected skin.

</p>

<h3>Creams (topical therapy)</h3>
<p>
    A <b>chemotherapy cream </b>called 5-fluorouracil (Efudix®) may be used. It’s also called 5FU. Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer drugs.
</p><p>
    You put the cream onto the skin regularly over a period of time. It can make the skin in the area red and inflamed before the
    Bowen’s disease gets better. Usually there are no other side effects.
</p><p>
    A cream called <b>Imiquimod (Aldara®) </b>can also be used. This works by using the immune system to attack the abnormal cells.
    You put it on the skin regularly over a period of time. It will cause some redness and skin irritation before the Bowen’s disease improves.
</p>
<h3>Surgery</h3>
<p>
    Surgery may be used for small areas of Bowen’s disease that can be removed under local anaesthetic. This is not always
    the best option for large patches of Bowen’s disease.

</p>

<h3>Photodynamic therapy (PDT)</h3>
<p>
    Photodynamic therapy is a treatment that is used for different conditions. It can be a useful option for people with
    large areas of Bowen’s disease. It uses light combined with a light-sensitive drug (sometimes called a photosensitising agent)
    to destroy abnormal cells.</p><p>

    A photosensitising cream is put on the affected area. About 3–4 hours later, special light is shone onto the area for about 10–15 minutes.
    Afterwards, a dressing is put on to cover the area and protect it from light. Usually, more than one treatment is needed.
</p>

<h3>Curettage and electrocautery</h3>
<p>

    Scraping away the affected area (curettage) and using heat or electricity to stop any bleeding (electrocautery) are suitable
    for small patches of Bowen’s disease. A local anaesthetic is given before the doctor scrapes away the area using a spoon-shaped
    instrument called a curette.</p><p>

    An electrically heated loop or needle is then used to stop the bleeding from the wound (cauterise it) and destroy any remaining
    abnormal cells. After this treatment, a scar may develop.
</p>
<h3>Laser treatment</h3>
<p>
    Laser treatment uses intense light energy to remove tissue. It's sometimes used as a treatment for Bowen's disease
    affecting the finger or genitals.
