        <h2>What is Erythema Nodosum?</h2>


<p>
Erythema nodosum is a skin condition that causes painful swollen red or 
purple bumps most commonly on the shins. Sometimes the bumps can also form 
on other parts of the body.
<br><br>
This condition is the most common form of panniculitis, which is inflammation 
of the fat layer underneath the skin. It’s often caused by an immune response 
to an infection or a reaction to drugs you’ve taken.

      <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Erythema nodosum can develop in persons of any age, sex, and ethnicity. 
Young adults are particularly susceptible to developing erythema nodosum.
 Moreover, women are 4 times more likely than men to be affected.
<br><br>
Approximately 30–50% of cases of erythema nodosum have no underlying cause. 
However, an associated medication, infection, or health condition may be 
found in the remainder of cases.
<br><br>
Erythema nodosum may develop in people on these medications:
<ul>
<li>Birth control pills</li>
<li>Estrogen pills</li>
<li>Antibiotics (such as sulfonamides or penicillin)</li>
</ul>
Erythema nodosum may occur in persons with one of the following infections:
<ul>
<li>Streptococcal infections (such as strep throat)</li>
<li>Intestinal infections</li>
<li>Tuberculosis</li>
<li>Pneumonia (viral or bacterial)</li>
<li>Fungal infections (such as coccidioidomycosis or histoplasmosis)</li>
</ul>
Erythema nodosum may be seen in individuals with one of these underlying 
medical conditions:
<ul>
<li>Pregnancy</li>
<li>Inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease)</li>
<li>Sarcoidosis</li>
<li>Lymphoma or leukemia</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The main symptom is red, painful bumps on the lower part of your legs. 
Sometimes these bumps can also appear on your thighs, arms, torso, and face.
<br><br>
The lumps can be one-half inch up to 4 inches. You may have anywhere from 
two to 50 of them.
<br><br>
Erythema nodosum bumps are painful and they may feel hot. They start out 
red, and then turn purple, looking like bruises as they heal. They also 
flatten out while healing.
<br><br>
The bumps can last for two weeks. New bumps can keep forming for up to six weeks.
<br><br>
Other symptoms of erythema nodosum include:

<ul>
<li>fever</li>
<li>fatigue</li>
<li>joint pain</li>
<li>pain in the legs</li>
<li>ankle swelling</li>
<li>enlarged lymph nodes in the chest</li>
<li>cough</li>
<li>sore throat</li>
<li>weight loss</li>
<li>stomach pain</li>
<li>diarrhea</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Causes</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
In more than half of all cases the cause is unknown. Erythema nodosum often 
starts after you’ve had an infection or you’ve used certain medicines. Doctors 
believe it may be caused by an immune system overreaction to bacteria and other
 substances you’re exposed to.
<br><br>
Causes include:
 
 <ul>
<li>infections such as strep throat or tuberculosis</li>
<li>reactions to drugs such as antibiotics (sulfonamides and forms of penicillin),
 salicylates, iodides, bromides, and birth control pills</li>
<li>sarcoidosis, a condition that causes inflammation in many parts of the body</li>
<li>coccidioidomycosis, an infection of the lungs and upper respiratory tract</li>
<li>inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease</li>
<li>pregnancy</li>
<li>cancer (rarely)</li>
</ul>
Erythema nodosum most often affects people ages 20 to 40. Women are six times 
more likely to develop it than men. However, it can happen in people of any
 age and in both sexes.

      <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Although erythema nodosum may occur on its own, it is more often associated 
with a medication or with an underlying infection or medical condition. 
Therefore, it is important to see a physician in order to investigate any
 possible health problems. In the meantime, however, the tenderness of 
 the skin lesions may be alleviated by the following:
<br><br>

 <ul>
<li>Restriction of physical activity or bed rest</li>
<li>Elevation of the legs (if they are affected)</li>
<li>Cool or warm compresses</li>
</ul>
Generally, people with erythema nodosum do quite well, especially once 
any underlying medical condition has been treated.

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
If a bacterial infection caused this condition, your doctor will prescribe 
antibiotics to treat it. You can treat erythema nodosum that’s caused by a 
drug reaction by stopping the medicine.
<br><br>
These medicines can help you manage pain and other symptoms until the lumps heal:
<br><br>

 <ul>
<li>nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), 
or naproxen (Aleve) (Don’t use these if you have Crohn’s disease because 
they could trigger a flare.)</li>
<li>potassium iodide</li>
<li>oral steroids</li>
</ul>
Also, rest with your legs elevated and wear compression stockings while the bumps heal.
 And avoid irritating the bumps by wearing itchy or tight clothing.

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Your doctor will ask about your health history, and whether you’ve recently 
had an infection or used certain medicines. Then your doctor will look at the bumps.
<br><br>
You’ll likely get a blood test to look for signs of inflammation in your body. 
Blood tests can also be used to check for tuberculosis and other infections. 
You may have a throat culture to look for strep throat.
<br><br>
Other tests to look for the causes of erythema nodosum include:
<br><br>

 
 <ul>
<li>urine test</li>
<li>chest X-ray</li>
<li>stool culture</li>
</ul>

Your doctor may remove a sample of tissue from the fat layer under your skin. 
This test is called a biopsy. A technician at a lab will look at the sample under
 a microscope to check for changes related to erythema nodosum.

      <h2>In pregnancy</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
About 5 percent of pregnant women develop erythema nodosum. The cause may be 
increased estrogen levels during pregnancy.
<br><br>
Erythema nodosum is treated in much the same way during pregnancy as it is in
 women who aren’t pregnant. However, some of the medicines like NSAIDs used to 
 treat this condition can’t be used during pregnancy. Bed rest and compression 
 stockings can help manage pain and other symptoms.
<br><br>
Your obstetrician can tell you the best way to control erythema nodosum during 
pregnancy. The bumps should fade within a few weeks.

      <h2>Outlook</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Erythema nodosum can be uncomfortable, but it’s usually not serious.
<br><br>
The bumps will often fade within two to four weeks, but they can take up to two 
months to heal completely. You’ll likely have some bruising as the bumps fade, 
but they usually don’t leave scars.
<br><br>
Pain in your legs can continue for up to two years after erythema nodosum heals. 
It’s also possible the condition can come back in the future.
