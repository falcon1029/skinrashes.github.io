        <h2>What is Granuloma Annulare?</h2>


<p>
Granuloma annulare is a skin condition that most commonly consists of raised, 
reddish or skin-colored bumps (lesions) that form ring patterns â€” usually on
 your hands and feet.
<br><br>
No one knows exactly what causes granuloma annulare. But it may be triggered 
by minor skin injuries and certain medications. Some types of granuloma annulare
 affect adults, and others typically affect children.
<br><br>
In most cases, granuloma annulare isn't itchy or painful, so no treatment is 
necessary. The lesions usually disappear on their own within two years. If you're 
bothered by how your skin looks, your doctor can prescribe medications that will 
speed the disappearance of the lesions.

     <h2>Types of granuloma annulare</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Here are some of the main types of granuloma annulaire:
<br><br>
<ol>
<li><b> Localised granuloma annulare</b>The most common type, localised 
granuloma annulare, appears in just one or two areas, tends to affect children 
and young adults, and usually gets better on its own after a few months.
<br><br>
Pink, purple or skin-coloured patches typically appear on the fingers, backs of
 the hands, feet, ankles or elbows. 
 <br><br>
They form rings that grow slowly until they're about 2.5-5cm (1-2 inches) across.
 As the rings get bigger, they become flatter and more purple in colour before 
 eventually fading.
 <br><br>
 In localised granuloma annulare, the top of the skin feels smooth and, unlike 
 in other skin conditions, such as pityriasis versicolor, ringworm or eczema, 
 it isn't rough, dry or scaly.
 <br><br>
The affected skin also feels firm as a result of inflammation in the middle
 layer of skin (dermis). There's no change in the outermost layer of skin 
 (epidermis).</li>
 
<li><b> Widespread granuloma annulare</b>More rarely, you can develop 
a widespread rash, known as generalised or disseminated granuloma annulare. 
It usually affects adults.
 <br><br>
Large pink, purple or skin-coloured patches appear on a larger portion of 
the body, including the trunk, arms and legs.
 <br><br>
The rash is sometimes made up of small raised spots that form symmetrical 
rings 10cm (4 inches) or more across. They're often found in skin folds 
in the armpits and groin.</li>

<li><b> Under the skin</b>Granuloma annulare under the skin usually 
affects children. One or more firm, rubbery lumps develop under the skin.
 <br><br>
They can range from 5mm-4cm (0.2-1.5 inches) in size.
 <br><br>
They can appear on the shins, ankles, feet, buttocks, hands, scalp and eyelids.</li>

</ol>

     <h2>Causes</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
No one knows exactly what causes granuloma annulare. But in some people, 
the condition may be triggered by:
<ul>
<li>Animal or insect bites</li>
<li>Infections, including hepatitis</li>
<li>Tuberculin skin tests</li>
<li>Vaccinations</li>
<li>Sun exposure</li>
<li>Other minor injury to the skin</li>
</ul>
Granuloma annulare is not contagious.

     <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Although granuloma annulare can occur in people of any race and at any age, 
it is most commonly seen in children and young adults. Females are slightly 
more likely than males to develop granuloma annulare.
<br><br>
Granuloma annulare is occasionally associated with diabetes or thyroid disease, 
most often when lesions are numerous or widespread.

     <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Your doctor may diagnose granuloma annulare by examining the affected skin. 
He or she may take a small skin sample (biopsy) to examine under a microscope.

    <h2>Treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
In most cases, no treatment is necessary for granuloma annulare. Most 
lesions disappear within a few months, and rarely last more than two years.
<br><br>
 If the appearance of your skin bothers you, your doctor may recommend:
<ul>
<li><b>Corticosteroid creams or ointments.</b>Prescription-strength products 
may help improve the appearance of the lesions and speed their disappearance. 
Your doctor may direct you to cover the cream with bandages or an adhesive patch, 
to increase the effectiveness of this treatment.</li>
<li><b>Corticosteroid injections.</b>If the skin lesions are thicker and your 
symptoms are greater, your doctor may inject corticosteroids directly into the 
lesions to help them disappear faster.</li>
<li><b>Freezing the lesions.</b>Applying liquid nitrogen to the affected area 
can help remove the lesions and stimulate the growth of new skin.</li>
<li><b>Light therapy.</b>Exposing the lesions to particular types of light 
is sometimes helpful. Certain types of laser treatments also work for some people.</li>
<li><b>Oral medications.</b>In severe cases, especially when the lesions are 
widespread, your doctor might prescribe antibiotics, antimalarials or drugs 
used to prevent immune system reactions.</li>
</ul>
