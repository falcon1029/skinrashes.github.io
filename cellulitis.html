    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>What is Cellulitis?</h2>
Cellulitis is an infection of the skin and is most often caused by the 
bacteria Streptococcus or Staphylococcus. These bacteria are able to 
enter the skin through small cracks (fissures), causing the sudden appearance 
of redness, swelling, and warmth in the skin. Cellulitis is sometimes 
accompanied by fever, chills, and general fatigue.
<br><br>
If the infection is left untreated for too long, cellulitis can result in pockets 
of pus (abscesses) or the spread of bacteria into the bloodstream (bacteremia). 
However, most cases of cellulitis resolve with appropriate antibiotic therapy.

      <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Cellulitis can affect any part of the body, but the most common locations are:

<ul>
<li>Lower legs</li>
<li>Arms or hands</li>
<li>Face</li>
</ul>
The symptoms of cellulitis may include:
<ul>
<li>pain and tenderness in the affected area</li>
<li>redness or inflammation of your skin</li>
<li>a skin sore or rash that appears and grows quickly</li>
<li>a tight, glossy, swollen appearance of the skin</li>
<li>a feeling of warmth in the affected area</li>
<li>a central area that has an abscess with pus formation</li>
<li>a fever</li>

</ul>
Some common symptoms of a more serious cellulitis infection are:
<ul>
<li>shaking</li>
<li>chills</li>
<li>a feeling of illness</li>
<li>fatigue</li>
<li>dizziness</li>
<li>lightheadedness</li>
<li>muscle aches</li>
<li>warm skin</li>
<li>sweating</li>
</ul>
Symptoms such as the following could signal that cellulitis is spreading:
<ul>
<li>drowsiness</li>
<li>lethargy</li>
<li>blistering</li>
<li>red streaks</li>
</ul>

Cellulitis initially appears as pink-to-red minimally inflamed skin. The 
involved area may rapidly become deeper red, swollen, warm, and tender and 
increase in size as the infection spreads. Occasionally, red streaks may 
radiate outward from the cellulitis. Blisters or pus-filled bumps may also 
be present.
<br><br>
Cellulitis may be accompanied by swollen lymph nodes, fever, chills, and fatigue.

      <h2>Diagnosing cellulitis</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Your doctor can usually diagnose cellulitis on sight, but they’ll perform a 
physical exam to determine the extent of your condition. This exam might reveal:
<ul>
<li>swelling of the skin</li>
<li>redness and warmth of the affected area</li>
<li>swollen glands</li>
</ul>
Depending on the severity of your symptoms, your doctor may want to monitor the 
affected area for a few days to see if redness or swelling spread. In some cases, 
your doctor may perform a blood test or a culture of the wound to test for the
 presence of bacteria.

      <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
If you think you have cellulitis, make an appointment to see your doctor. 
While you are waiting for the appointment with your physician, you can elevate 
the involved body part in order to decrease swelling. A cool, clean, moist towel 
can be applied to the area to decrease pain.

      <h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
If you develop a tender, red, warm, enlarging area on your skin, make an appointment 
with your physician as soon as possible to get treatment and to avoid complications 
that may occur if cellulitis is left untreated. If you also have fever and chills,
 or if the area involves the face, you should go to the emergency room.
<br><br>
If you are currently being treated for a skin infection that has not improved after 
2–3 days of antibiotics, return to your doctor. You may need treatment with different
 medications, or the infection may have spread deeper into your skin.
<br><br>
Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is a strain 
of "staph" bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics in the penicillin family. This class
 of antibiotics has been the cornerstone of antibiotic therapy for staph and skin infections 
 for decades. CA-MRSA previously infected only small segments of the population, such as
 health care workers and persons using injection drugs. However, CA-MRSA is now a common 
 cause of skin infections in the general population. While CA-MRSA bacteria are resistant 
 to penicillin and penicillin-related antibiotics, most CA-MRSA infections can easily be 
 treated with commonly available nonpenicillin antibiotics. Rarely, CA-MRSA can cause a
 deeper skin infection, which usually requires intravenous (IV) antibiotics to treat the
 infection. There is an additional strain of MRSA (hospital-acquired MRSA), usually found 
 in health care settings, that is susceptible only to intravenous antibiotics, so admission
 to the hospital is often needed for effective treatment.

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Your physician will usually be able to easily diagnose cellulitis by examining the 
affected area. Sometimes your doctor may want to get additional information by ordering
 blood tests and/or performing a bacterial culture in order to identify the specific bacterium 
 that is causing the cellulitis as well as to test its susceptibility to different antibiotics 
 to help guide treatment decisions.
<br><br>
A bacterial culture involves the following:

<ul>
<li>Opening a blister or pus-filled bump with a needle, scalpel, or lancet after cleansing the skin.</li>
<li>Rubbing a sterile cotton-tipped applicator across the skin to collect the sample.</li>
<li>Sending the specimen to a laboratory.</li>
</ul>
Typically, the laboratory will have preliminary results within 48–72 hours if there are
 many bacteria present. However, the culture may take a full week or more to produce final 
 results. In addition to identifying the type of bacterium that is causing the cellulitis, 
 the laboratory usually performs antibiotic sensitivity testing in order to determine the 
 antibiotics that will be most effective in treating the bacteria.
<br><br>
While waiting for the results from the bacterial culture, your doctor may want to start you 
on an antibiotic to fight the most common bacteria that cause cellulitis. Once the final culture 
results have returned, your physician may change the antibiotic you are taking, especially if 
the infection is not improving.
<br><br>
Mild cases of cellulitis in a healthy person can be treated with oral antibiotic pills. Common 
antibiotics that are used to treat cellulitis include the following:

<ul>
<li>Dicloxacillin</li>
<li>Cephalexin</li>
<li>Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</li>
<li>Clindamycin</li>
<li>Doxycycline</li>
<li>Linezolid</li>
</ul>
Someone who appears to be very sick or who has other chronic illnesses that may complicate
 their recovery may need to be hospitalized to receive intravenous antibiotics. Common intravenous 
 antibiotics that are used to treat cellulitis include the following:
 <ul>
<li>Nafcillin</li>
<li>Oxacillin</li>
<li>Cefazolin</li>
<li>Vancomycin</li>
</ul>
 If your doctor prescribes antibiotics, be sure to take the full course of treatment. In addition 
 to prescribing antibiotics, your doctor will likely want to make sure that your underlying medical
 problems, if any, are being adequately managed.

      <h2>Possible complications of cellulitis</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Sometimes cellulitis can spread throughout the body, entering the lymph nodes and bloodstream. 
In rare cases, it can enter into deeper layers of tissue. Potential complications 
that can occur are:
<ul>
<li>a blood infection</li>
<li>a bone infection</li>
<li>an inflammation of your lymph vessels</li>
<li>tissue death, or gangrene</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Preventing cellulitis</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
If you have a break in your skin, clean it immediately and apply antibiotic ointment regularly. 
Cover your wound with a bandage and change it daily, until a scab forms. Watch your wounds for 
redness, drainage, or pain. These symptoms could indicate an infection. People with poor circulation 
or who have pre-existing conditions that put them at risk for cellulitis should take extra 
precautions, including:
<ul>
<li>keeping skin moist to prevent cracking</li>
<li>promptly treating superficial skin infections, such as athlete’s foot</li>
<li>wearing protective equipment when working or playing</li>
<li>inspecting feet daily for signs of injury or infection</li>
</ul>
