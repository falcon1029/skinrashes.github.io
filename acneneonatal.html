        <h2>What is Baby Acne?</h2>
Babies can develop blemishes on their face that looks exactly like acne commonly
 seen in teens. Although the cause of baby acne is unknown, it may be the result
 of maternal or infant hormones (androgens) stimulating glands in the face to 
 produce oil, or sebum. Baby acne can essentially be divided into 2 groups:
 neonatal acne, which affects babies in their first month of life; and 
 infantile acne, which typically affects babies 3 to 16 months of age.
 Neonatal acne that is confined to the face is called benign cephalic 
 pustulosis, while infantile acne is usually more severe than neonatal 
 acne and consists of more lesions. The later form may last a few weeks 
 to a few months, but most cases usually resolve by age 3.

       <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Neonatal acne occurs in about 20% of newborns. Infantile acne appears 
to be less common. Males tend to be more affected than females, although 
this reason is unknown.

       <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Baby acne consists of multiple red, raised pimples and pus-filled bumps, commonly 
found on the baby's face, neck or trunk. Skin can have blackheads and 
whiteheads present as well. Pitting and scarring of the affected areas 
can occur in approximately 10 to 15% of affected infants.

       <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
In mild cases of baby acne, using a daily cleanser is usually the first step 
in treatment. Gentle, fragrance-free cleansers are best and should be applied 
to the affected area daily. Newborns and infants have very sensitive skin, so 
vigorous scrubbing should be avoided.

       <h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
In general, baby acne is harmless and does not require urgent care. If you 
have any questions or feel that the acne on your baby's skin is worsening 
despite using daily cleansing with a gentle soap, it is best to see your 
pediatrician. Additionally, if your baby is prone to scratching or picking
 at these lesions, there is a risk the affected areas could develop a 
 bacterial skin infection, and it is best to seek further medical care.

      <h2>Treatments</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
In mild cases, prescription therapy is generally unnecessary, and the lesions 
may resolve with gentle cleansing of the skin. The first-line treatment most
 physicians prescribe is 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. This is an gel that is applied 
 to the skin; it is a commonly used acne product. It is generally well tolerated
 but may cause dryness. The next line of therapy, in severe cases, is to add an
 oral antibiotic. Most infants are able to stop oral antibiotics within 18 months.
 Rarely, cases of acne could be made worse by a fungus, which would require a 
 topical antifungal applied to the skin for treatment. Your baby's pediatrician 
 may request the help of a pediatric dermatologist for severe cases of acne. 
 Furthermore, in severe cases or those resistant to therapy, an investigation 
 for an underlying hormonal (endocrine) disorder may be warranted.
