        <h2>What is Post-Inflammatory Hypopigmentation?</h2>


<p>
<b>Hypopigmentation</b> is the absence of normal amounts of melanin (the chemical that
 gives skin its color) caused by disease, injury, burns or other trauma to the skin.
 Hypopigmentation can be tricky to treat. There are topical medications that 
 sometimes help, and light-based procedures like IPL, excimer lasers, and the 
 Fraxel Restore laser can also be used.
<br><br>
Melanin is the substance that gives skin its color, or pigment. When the skin 
cells that produce melanin (melanocytes) reduce their production, the resulting 
condition is known as hypopigmentation (loss of skin color).  Hypopigmentation is 
also known as skin depigmentation.
<br><br>
<b>Post-inflammatory hypopigmentation</b> is a loss of skin color (pigmentation) after your 
skin heals from an injury. The pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) are damaged or 
destroyed in the healing process.

     <h2>Hypopigmentation causes</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The most common cause of hypopigmentation is<b>damage or trauma</b> to the skin. Burns, infections, 
pimples, blisters, scrapes, and any injuries that result in scarring can all lead to 
skin discoloration.
<br><br>
Improperly administered <b>skin resurfacing treatments</b>, such as Photofacials (IPL), laser 
peels, or chemical peels, can cause skin damage that results in hypopigmentation.

     <h2>Post inflammatory hypopigmentation</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
In situations where<b> hypopigmentation</b> is the result of <b>skin inflammation or damage</b>, the condition 
may be referred to as post-inflammatory hypopigmentation, or PIH.

This can get confusing because PIH is also used to refer to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, 
a skin condition where pigmentation is increased, not decreased.

     <h2>Other hypopigmentation causes</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Some chronic skin disorders can also cause hypopigmentation, such as the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Albinism</b> - characterized by colorless skin, hair, and eyes that occurs because 
skin cells produce little or no melanin</li>
<li><b>Vitiligo </b> - characterized by patchy loss of skin color that occurs when skin cells 
that produce melanin die or stop production for no known reason</li>
<li><b>Seborrheic dermatitis</b> - an inflammatory skin disease characterized by red, scaly, 
itchy patches of skin in areas prone to oiliness</li>
<li><b>Tinea versicolor</b> - caused by fungal (yeast) infection and characterized by scaly, 
itchy patches of lighter or pinkish skin</li>
<li><b>Pityriasis alba</b> - most commonly affects children and is characterized by 
colorless, scaly skin patches</li>
</ul>

     <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Anyone can experience pigment loss, but it is often more prominent in darker-skinned
 people due to the contrast with their normal skin color. It can occur with any skin 
 injury (burns, cuts, or surgery) or with many skin disorders (acne, eczema, chickenpox, 
 seborrheic dermatitis, and others). Some medications may cause skin lightening in 
 dark-skinned people (eg, strong cortisone creams or benzoyl peroxide products).

     <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
One or more areas of white or lighter areas of skin. The size, shape, and area(s)
 affected depend upon the cause.

     <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Stop any creams or lotions with benzoyl peroxide or strong cortisone. If there are 
only a few areas and you have no underlying skin problem, no treatment is needed. 
In mild cases, the skin restores pigment on its own.
</div>

     <h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Seek medical care if you have multiple unexplained, lighter skin areas; 
if you have a single lighter skin area with no history of previous injury;
 or if you have a lighter skin area that is numb or has lost sensation or feeling.
<br><br>
Seek medical care if you have any skin condition that leaves multiple 
lighter skin spots.

     <h2>Hypopigmentation treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Hypopigmentation treatment options are often limited. Treating post-inflammatory 
hypopigmentation may involve the use of<b> topical corticosteroids or tars (topical cream),
 light or laser treatment, or surgical skin grafting.</b>
<br><br>
Although the numerous lasers and other light-based treatments available today are 
often perceived as a cosmetic cure-alls,<b> IPL, excimer lasers, and the Fraxel 
Restore laser</b> are the only <b>light-based procedures</b> that have been suggested by 
the doctors on RealSelf for hypopigmentation treatment.
<br><br>
If a <b>chronic skin disorder</b> is causing hypopigmentation, then treatment will likely
 involve topical prescription medications. For hypopigmentation that is unresponsive 
 to medications, <b>camouflaging with cosmetic tattooing or permanent makeup</b> may 
 be the best option.
<br><br>
For patients who experience extreme hypopigmentation on over half of their body 
(a rare occurrence of vitiligo), overall depigmentation is an option.
<br><br>
Topical medications, such as<b> hydroquinone, TriLuma,</b> and other skin lightening 
agents, may be used to bleach skin not affected by hypopigmentation so that it 
can blend in better with hypopigmented skin (think the late, great Michael Jackson).
