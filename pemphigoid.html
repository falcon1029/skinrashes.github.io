        <h2>What is Pemphigoid?</h2>


<p>
Pemphigoid is a rare autoimmune disorder that can develop at any age, including 
in kids, but that most often affects the elderly. Pemphigoid is caused by a malfunction 
of the immune system and results in skin rashes and blistering on the legs, arms, and abdomen.
<br><br>
Pemphigoid can also cause blistering on the mucous membranes. Mucous membranes 
produce mucous that helps protect the inside of your body. Pemphigoid can be found 
on the mucous membranes in your eyes, nose, mouth, and genitals. It can also occur 
during pregnancy in some women.
<br><br>
There’s no cure for pemphigoid, but there are various treatment options.

     <h2>Types of pemphigoid</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
All types of pemphigoid are caused by your immune system attacking healthy tissue. 
They appear as rashes and fluid-filled blisters. The types of pemphigoid differ in 
terms of where on the body the blistering occurs and when it occurs.
<ul>
<li><b>Bullous pemphigoid: </b>In cases of bullous pemphigoid — the most common of 
the three types — the skin blistering happens most commonly on the arms and legs 
where movement occurs. This includes the areas around the joints and on the lower 
abdomen.</li>
<li><b>Cicatricial pemphigoid: </b>Cicatricial pemphigoid, also called mucous 
membrane pemphigoid, refers to blisters that form on the mucous membranes. 
This includes the:
<ul>
<li>mouth</li>
<li>eyes</li>
<li>nose</li>
<li>throat</li>
<li>genitals</li>
</ul>
The most common sites affected are the mouth and eyes. The rash and blistering may 
begin in one of these areas and spread to the others if left untreated. If it’s left 
untreated in the eyes, it may cause scarring, which in turn may lead to blindness.
</li>
<li><b>Pemphigoid gestationis: </b>When blistering occurs during or shortly after 
pregnancy, it’s called pemphigoid gestationis. It was formerly called herpes gestationis, 
although it’s not related to the herpes virus.
<br><br>
The blistering typically develops during the second or third trimester, but may occur at
 any time during pregnancy, or up to six weeks after delivery. Blisters tend to form on 
 the arms, legs, and abdomen.</li>
</ul>

     <h2>Causes and risk factors</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Pemphigoid is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system mistakenly begins 
to attack your healthy tissues. In the case of pemphigoid, your immune system creates 
antibodies to attack the tissue just below your outer layer of skin. This causes the 
layers of skin to separate and results in painful blistering. It’s not fully understood 
why the immune system reacts this way in people living with pemphigoid.
<br><br>
In many cases, there’s no specific trigger for pemphigoid, either. In some instances, 
however, it may be caused by:

<ul>
<li>certain medications</li>
<li>radiation therapy</li>
<li>ultraviolet light therapy</li>
</ul>
People with other autoimmune disorders are found to be at a higher risk for developing 
pemphigoid. It’s also more common in the elderly than in any other age group, and seems 
to occur slightly more in women than men.

     <h2>Symptoms of pemphigoid</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<p>

The most common symptom of pemphigoid is blistering that occurs on the arms, legs, 
abdomen, and mucous membranes. Hives and itching are also common. The blisters have 
certain characteristics, regardless of where on the body they form: 

<ul>
<li>a red rash develops before the blisters</li>
<li>the blisters are large and filled with fluid that’s usually clear, but may 
contain some blood</li>
<li>the blisters are thick and don’t rupture easily</li>
<li>the skin around the blisters may appear normal, or slightly red or dark</li>
<li>ruptured blisters are usually sensitive and painful</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Is pemphigoid hereditary?</h3>

<p>
No.
</p>
<h3>Can pemphigoid be cured?</h3>

<p>
No. Treatment helps a lot, but controls the condition rather than curing it 
completely. However, pemphigoid does often go away by itself after one to five years.

     <h2>Diagnosing pemphigoid</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Usually the look of the rash is enough to make the diagnosis, but it is 
essential to get further proof. 
<ul>
<li>Examination of a biopsy taken from a small and early blister will show that 
it has come up just under the outermost layer of the skin (i.e. it is a 
‘subepidermal’ blister).</li>
<li>Special testing (immunofluorescence) of a sample of normal skin (i.e. 
taken from an area where there is no blister) will show up a layer of antibodies 
that also lies just under the outer layer of the skin.</li>
<li>The same pemphigoid antibodies can be detected circulating in the blood.</li>
</ul>

     <h2>Treatments for pemphigoid</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Treatment has three aims – to stop new blisters coming up; to heal the blisters 
that are already there; and to use the smallest possible doses of the medicines,
 as side effects can be common and severe in the elderly.
 <ul>
<li>A steroid cream can help if only a small area of skin is affected. Even if 
the rash is more extensive, a trial of a strong steroid cream may be worthwhile 
before tablets are given, as creams are much less likely to cause side effects.</li>
<li>Antibiotics called tetracyclines, sometimes combined with nicotinamide, 
may help and can be combined with other treatments.</li>
<li>Treatment for more severe blistering is usually with high doses of steroid 
tablets to get the pemphigoid under control quickly. This needs careful monitoring, 
especially in elderly patients or those taking other medicines. Treatment may 
sometimes be started in hospital to ensure good control and so that proper dressings 
can be used on the blisters and raw areas. Some patients can come off their 
treatment gradually, usually after a few months; others will need to go on with lower 
doses for a long time. Calcium and vitamin D supplements, or other medications, should 
be given to keep your bones strong.</li>
<li>Other tablets that affect the immune system can be used at the same time as the 
steroid tablets, the aim being to reduce the steroid dose (i.e. to have a 
‘steroid sparing’ effect). The idea is that the side effects will be less troublesome 
if a low dose of two tablets is used rather than a high dose of a single type of tablet. 
Examples of additional tablets that can be used in this way are azathioprine and, dapsone. 
However, they can all cause side effects too, and their use has to be considered carefully. 
Your dermatologist will discuss this aspect of your treatment with you.</li>
</ul>

     <h2>Long-term outlook</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
With comprehensive treatment, the outlook for pemphigoid is good. Most people respond 
well to medication. The disease will often go away after a few years of treatment. 
But pemphigoid may return at any time, even with proper treatment.
<br><br>
If you develop any unexplained blistering, see your doctor. Prompt diagnosis and treatment
 will help to manage this condition faster.

     <h2>Self care (What can I do?)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<ul>
<li>Never change the dosage of the tablets you are taking without talking first to your doctor.</li>
<li>Avoid hard or rough foods if you have sore areas in your mouth.</li>
