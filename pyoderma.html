<h2>What is pyoderma gangrenosum? </h2>

<p>
    Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare treatable cause of skin ulcers. It is not related to gangrene. Pyoderma gangrenosum
    is not ‘catching’ and cannot be transferred from or to another person by touching or in any other way.

     <h2>What causes pyoderma gangrenosum?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    For about half of the people with pyoderma gangrenosum there are no known reasons for it. It may start after minor skin
    damage or injury. Sometimes other conditions may be associated with pyoderma gangrenosum, such as inflammatory bowel
    disease (IBD), arthritis or certain blood disorders. It is important to know that having pyoderma gangrenosum does
    not mean that you have these diseases.

     <h2>What does pyoderma gangrenosum look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Pyoderma gangrenosum usually occurs in young and middle-aged adults but the way it looks can vary from person to person.
    It may start as a small pimple, red bump or blood-blister. The skin then breaks down resulting in an ulcer which often
    oozes fluid. The ulcer can enlarge rapidly. The edge of the ulcer may look purplish. The most common places where
    pyoderma gangrenosum occurs are the legs, although it can be found anywhere on the body. Sometimes it may occur
    around the site of a stoma (e.g. colostomy), or in a surgical wound.

     <h2>Symptoms of pyoderma gangrenosum</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    In pyoderma gangrenosum, there is usually a single large ulcer but occasionally there may be multiple ulcers.
    Ulcers may become infected, oozing fluid or pus. Pain or discomfort are common symptoms. Pyoderma gangrenosum
    is not cancer and does not lead to cancer.

     <h2>How is pyoderma gangrenosum diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    There is no specific blood test for pyoderma gangrenosum. Certain conditions such as venous ulcers, inflammation of
    blood vessels, infection, injury, inflammatory disorders and cancer can look like pyoderma gangrenosum. This is why
    your doctor may take a sample of skin (biopsy) to examine under the microscope in a laboratory to confirm the diagnosis.
    The wound should also be swabbed and cultured for bacteria to rule out associated infection. Your doctor may also
    request blood tests to check for conditions that may be associated with pyoderma gangrenosum.

     <h2>How can pyoderma gangrenosum be treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

<p>
    Pyoderma gangrenosum is often difficult to treat and may take some time to
    heal. More than one treatment may need to be tried. Skin grafts and surgery
    are not treatment options as they often fail and may cause enlargement of the
    ulcer.<br><br>
    Treatment may be divided into local treatment (topical) or systemic. The
    specific treatment depends on the severity of the disease.

</p>
<h3>1.Local applications to the skin (topical treatments)
</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>Strong steroid preparations or calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus) applied
        topically to the affected skin often help, especially with small ulcers,
        and may help to reduce the pain.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<h3>2.Systemic treatments
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Oral treatments </b>such as antibiotics (e.g. minocycline) or dapsone may
        be useful when treating small ulcers. Dapsone can affect the
        haemoglobin level in the blood. Blood tests are performed weekly to
        begin with, and patients are asked to report any unusual symptoms
        (sore throat, dizziness or faintness) urgently to their doctor. Dapsone
        also causes some patients to have headaches.</li>
    <li><b>Steroid tablets </b>(e.g. prednisolone) are used to reduce inflammation.
        They may be used alone or in combination with other
        immunosuppressive agents. If taken for many months prednisolone
        may cause side effects including high blood pressure (hypertension)
        and high blood sugar (diabetes). Long-term oral steroid use can cause
        other side effects including bone thinning (osteoporosis). Your
        pharmacist may give you a card to carry if you have to take steroid
        tablets for a long time. </li>
    <li><b>Immunosuppressive medicines </b>reduce the action of the body’s own
        defence system (the immune system). They are often used to make
        kidney, liver and heart transplants successful, but are also often useful
        to treat other severe skin conditions and severe pyoderma
        gangrenosum. Each one of these medicines has potential side effects
        and regular monitoring for side effects is an important part of your care. </li>
    <li><b>Immunosuppressive medicines include:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Mycophenolate mofetil</li>
        <li>Ciclosporin</li>
        <li>Azathioprine </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
