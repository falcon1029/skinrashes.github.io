        <h2>What is Epidermoid Cyst?</h2>


<p>
Epidermoid cysts, sometimes known as sebaceous cysts (a misnomer), contain a soft 
"cheesy" material composed of keratin, a protein component of skin, hair, and nails.
<ul>
<li>Epidermoid cysts form when the top layer of skin (epidermis) grows into the
 middle layer of the skin (dermis). This may occur due to injury or blocked
 hair follicles.</li>
<li>The lesion may be asymptomatic, but rupture of the epidermoid cyst can 
result in significant discomfort.</li>
</ul>

      <h2>What causes epidermoid cysts?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Epidermoid cysts are usually caused by a buildup of keratin. Keratin is a 
protein that occurs naturally in skin cells. Cysts develop when the protein is 
trapped below the skin because of disruption to the skin or to a hair follicle. 
These cysts often develop in response to skin trauma, HPV infection, acne, or 
excessive exposure to the sun. An epidermoid cyst is more likely to develop in 
people with acne or other skin conditions.

<h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
<p>
Epidermoid cysts are a common lesion that affect people of all ages.

      <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Epidermoid cysts can be located almost anywhere but are most common on the 
face, neck, scalp, or trunk.
<ul>
<li>A cyst appears as a dome-shaped, skin-colored growth that usually moves 
when touched and pressed upon. It may have a small opening in the center.</li>
<li>The cyst can be well-defined or irregular due to prior rupture, scarring, and regrowth.</li>
<li>If manipulated or infected, the cyst can become red and may be tender.</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
None necessary. It is advised not to try to express the material within cysts as further 
inflammation and even infection may result.

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

<ul>
<li>Inflamed, non-infected cysts may be injected with steroids to reduce inflammation.</li>
<li>Incision and drainage can provide immediate reduction in the cyst. However, 
this is a temporary measure. After this treatment, a cyst will refill with the cheesy 
contents because the lining of the cyst has not been removed.</li>
<li>Cysts may be removed (excised) surgically.</li>
</ul>

      <h2>What is the outlook for epidermoid cysts?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
In most cases, epidermoid cysts cause no long-term problems. Squeezing out the contents 
of the cyst on your own can lead to infection, so itâ€™s best to leave the cyst alone.
<b></b>
Once a cyst is drained, there is a possibility that it will grow back. Very rarely, 
epidermoid cysts can become cancerous. Any significant change in a cyst is reason 
to see your doctor.
