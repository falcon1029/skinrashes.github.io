        <h2>What is Tinea Versicolor?</h2>


<p>
The fungus<b> Malassezia </b>is a type of yeast found on the surface of the skin. It 
normally doesn’t cause any health problems. In fact, many of the microbiota 
(or microscopic organisms), including yeasts like Malassezia, that live in large 
communities on your skin help protect you from infections and other pathogens that 
can cause harm or disease. They live alongside your body’s cells in symbiotic 
relationships, with skin cells and tiny organisms supporting and benefiting each other.
<br><br>
Sometimes, however, this yeast can grow out of control and affect the natural color
 or pigmentation of your skin. When this happens, you may develop patches of skin 
 that are lighter or darker than the surrounding skin. This condition, which isn’t 
 contagious, is known as tinea versicolor, or pityriasis versicolor. The condition 
 occurs when a type of yeast from the Malassezia family causes an infection or
 suppresses your immune system.

    <h2>Causes of Tinea Versicolor</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Tinea versicolor occurs when Malassezia grows rapidly on the surface of the skin. 
Doctors aren’t sure why this happens. 
<br><br>
Some factors may promote the growth of this yeast on the skin, including:
<ul>
<li>hot and humid weather</li>
<li>excessive sweating</li>
<li>oily skin</li>
<li>a weakened immune system</li>
<li>hormonal changes</li>
</ul>
Tinea versicolor can occur in people from all ethnic backgrounds, and it’s more common 
in adolescents and young adults. Adults are more likely to develop tinea versicolor 
if they visit an area with a subtropical climate.

    <h2>Symptoms of Tinea Versicolor</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<p>
Discolored patches of skin are the most noticeable symptom of tinea versicolor, and 
these patches usually show up on the arms, chest, neck, or back. These patches may be:
<ul>
<li>lighter (more common) or darker than the surrounding skin</li>
<li>pink, red, tan, or brown</li>
<li>dry, itchy, and scaly</li>
<li>more prominent with tanning</li>
<li>prone to disappear in cooler, less humid weather</li>
</ul>
Tinea versicolor that develops in people with dark skin may result in the loss of skin
 color, known as hypopigmentation. For some people, the skin may darken instead of lighten.
 This condition is known as hyperpigmentation.
<br><br>
Some individuals who develop tinea versicolor don’t have any significant changes in 
their skin color or appearance.
<br><br>
In addition to changes in the color of your skin, you may also experience itchy skin.
</p>

<h3>Similar conditions</h3>

<p>
Some conditions with overlapping symptoms, such as vitiligo, are often mistaken for 
tinea versicolor. However, vitiligo can differ from tinea versicolor in several 
noticeable ways, including:
<ul>
<li>Vitiligo doesn’t affect your skin’s texture.</li>
<li>Vitiligo usually appears on the fingers, wrists, armpits, mouth, eyes, or groin.</li>
<li>Vitiligo often forms patches that are symmetrical. </li>
</ul>
The rash caused by pityriasis rosea is also similar to tinea versicolor, but this rash
 is usually preceded by a “herald patch,” a lone red patch of scaly skin that appears a 
 few days or weeks before the rash. This rash typically appears in the shape of a 
 Christmas tree on the back. It’s not known what causes this condition. But, like 
 tinea versicolor, it’s neither harmful nor contagious.

    <div class="container">
Various environmental and biological factors can put you at a higher risk for 
this condition, including:
<ul>
<li>a family history of tinea versicolor</li>
<li>excessive sweating</li>
<li>a humid, warm climate</li>
<li>a weak immune system</li>
<li>taking medications that weaken the immune system</li>

    <h2>How is tinea versicolor diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
See your doctor if strangely colored patches develop on your skin and you can’t
 treat them at home. Your doctor will examine your skin and may be able to tell 
 if you have tinea versicolor just by looking at the patches.
<br><br>
If a diagnosis can’t be made by looking at the skin, your doctor may take a skin 
scraping. A skin scraping removes cells from your skin for testing by scraping the
 skin gently. The cells are viewed under a microscope to see if they contain the
 yeast that causes this condition. Your doctor can conduct a 
 potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy. In this procedure, your doctor takes a 
 skin sample, places it on a microscope slide with a solution of 20 percent KOH,
 and looks for yeast or hyphae fungi under a microscope.
<br><br>
Your doctor might also take a<b> biopsy,</b> or tissue sample, of the affected skin and 
test for fungi on the outer skin layer. A sample of the fungus on the skin can also 
be tested in a fungal culture to see if you have the condition.
<br><br>
Your doctor may also use a <b>Wood’s lamp</b> to look at your skin. This special machine,
 which uses ultraviolet light, is held 4 to 5 inches from your skin. If yeast is present, 
 the affected skin will appear yellow or green under the light.

    <h2>How is tinea versicolor treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
If your symptoms aren’t severe, you may choose to treat your condition at home. 
<b>OTC antifungal creams or shampoos </b>may be effective for killing the infection. 
Examples of OTC medications that can be used to treat tinea versicolor include:

<ul>
<li><b>clotrimazole</b>(Lotrimin AF, Mycelex)</li>
<li><b>miconazole</b>(Monistat, M-Zole)</li>
<li><b>selenium sulfide</b>(Selsun Blue shampoo)</li>
<li><b>terbinafine</b>(Lamisil)</li>
</ul>
If you seek medical attention for tinea versicolor, your doctor may prescribe 
different medications, such as topical creams that can be applied directly 
to the skin. 
<br><br>
Examples include:
<ul>
<li><b>ciclopirox</b>(Loprox, Penlac)</li>
<li><b>ketoconazole</b>(Extina, Nizoral)</li>
</ul>
Your doctor may also prescribe pills to treat tinea versicolor, including:
<ul>
<li><b>fluconazole</b> (Diflucan)</li>
<li><b>itraconazole</b>(Onmel, Sporanox)</li>
<li>ketoconazole</li>
</ul>

    <div class="container">
If you’re diagnosed with tinea versicolor, treatment will improve your long-term outlook.
 However, even after eliminating the infection, your skin may remain discolored for
 several weeks or months following treatment. Your infection may also return when 
 the weather becomes warmer and more humid. If your condition returns, your doctor 
 may prescribe medication once or twice per month to prevent symptoms.

    <h2>How can tinea versicolor be prevented?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
It can be difficult to prevent a recurrence of this condition. If you’ve been diagnosed 
with tinea versicolor and you’ve successfully treated it, there are steps you can take to
 prevent future infections. These include:
 
 <ul>
<li>avoiding excessive heat</li>
<li>avoiding tanning or excessive sun exposure</li>
<li>avoiding excessive sweating</li>
</ul>
 You can also help prevent tinea versicolor by using a prescription-strength skin treatment 
 during times of the year when you’re most susceptible to it.
