        <h2>What is Abscess?</h2>
An abscess is an infection characterized by a collection of pus underneath 
a portion of the skin. Bacteria commonly causing abscesses are Staphylococcus
 aureus and Streptococcus. These bacteria enter the skin through any cracks 
 or injury to the skin. That area of skin then becomes red, tender, warm, and
 swollen over days to 1 to 2 weeks and a fever may develop. Abscesses can
 sometimes form if minor superficial skin infections are not treated appropriately
 and in a timely fashion. Most abscesses resolve quickly once appropriately treated.
<br><br>
Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA)
 is a strain of "staph" bacteria resistant to antibiotics in the penicillin 
 family, which have been the cornerstone of antibiotic therapy for staph and 
 skin infections for decades. CA-MRSA previously infected only small segments 
 of the population, such as health care workers and persons using injection drugs.
 However, CA-MRSA is now a common cause of skin infections in the general population.
 While CA-MRSA bacteria are resistant to penicillin and penicillin-related
 antibiotics, most staph infections with CA-MRSA can be easily treated by 
 health care practitioners using local skin care and commonly available 
 non-penicillin-family antibiotics. Rarely, CA-MRSA can cause serious skin 
 and soft tissue (deeper) infections. Staph infections typically start as small 
 red bumps or pus-filled bumps, which can rapidly turn into deep, painful sores. 
 <br><br>
 If you see a red bump or pus-filled bump on the skin that is worsening or 
 showing any signs of infection (ie, the area becomes increasingly painful, 
 red, or swollen), see your doctor right away. Many patients believe incorrectly 
 that these bumps are the result of a spider bite when they arrive at the doctor's 
 office. Your doctor may need to test (culture) infected skin for MRSA before 
 starting antibiotics. If you have a skin problem that resembles a CA-MRSA 
 infection or a culture that is positive for MRSA, your doctor may need to
 provide local skin care and prescribe oral antibiotics. To prevent spread 
 of infection to others, infected wounds, hands, and other exposed body areas 
 should be kept clean and wounds should be covered during therapy.
<br><br>
Factors that predispose individuals to developing an abscess include:


<ul>
    <li>Any skin infection, especially those that are untreated</li>
    <li>Diabetes</li>
    <li>Obesity</li>
	<li>Intravenous drug abuse</li>
    <li>Weakened immune system due to underlying illness or medication</li>
    
</ul>

      <h2>Causes of abscess</h2>
    </div>

<div class="container">
Most abscesses are caused by a bacterial infection.<br><br>
When bacteria enter your body, your immune system sends infection-fighting 
white blood cells to the affected area.<br><br>
As the white blood cells attack the bacteria, some nearby tissue dies, creating
 a hole which then fills with pus to form an abscess. The pus contains a 
 mixture of dead tissue, white blood cells and bacteria.<br><br>
Internal abscesses often develop as a complication of an existing condition, 
such as an infection elsewhere in your body. For example, if your appendix bursts
 as a result of appendicitis, bacteria can spread inside your tummy (abdomen) 
 and cause an abscess to form.

      <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

<div class="container">

You are at an increased risk of developing abscesses if:
<ul>
    <li>You have a weak immune system due to HIV or chemotherapy</li>
    <li>You have diabetes</li>
    <li>You have hidradenitis suppurativa or another underlying inflammatory condition</li>
    <li>You have an infection caused by staphylococcal bacteria</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

<div class="container">
A skin abscess often appears as a swollen, pus-filled lump under the surface 
of the skin. You may also have other symptoms of an infection, such as a high 
temperature (fever) and chills.<br><br>

It's more difficult to identify an abscess inside the body, but signs include:

<ul>
    <li>pain in the affected area</li>
    <li>a high temperature</li>
    <li>generally feeling unwell</li>
    
</ul>

</div>

      <h2>Abscess development</h2>
    </div>

<div class="container">
You develop an abscess when your immune system isolates an infected area to keep
 the infection from spreading. Your immune system does it by sending leukocytes 
  specialized white blood cells  to the infected area. These cells fight and
 destroy infectious microorganisms such as parasites, bacteria, and viruses. 
 The clash between the bacteria and white blood cells leads to the formation 
 of pus within the involved tissue. A wall of tissue develops around the 
 infection site with time and this wall forms an abscess. Since an abscess 
 is swollen with puss, this makes many people wonder if it's contagious. 
 Let's find out.

      <h2>Are Abscesses Contagious?</h2>
    </div>

<div class="container">
A growing abscess is usually red and warm to the touch. It contains puss but it 
is not contagious. However, you need to understand that you develop an abscess 
because of a type of bacterial infection, and these bacteria can spread from 
person to person and cause different type of infections. You should wash your 
hand if you touch a boil that is draining pus. You should also wash your towels
or clothes that may have touched a draining or open carbuncle or boil.
<br><br>
You develop an abscess usually because you are infected with staphylococcal bacteria, 
but fungal, viral, and parasitic infections can also cause abscesses. Here is more
 about different types of abscesses to help you find an answer to, "Are abscesses 
 contagious?"
 
 <ul>
    <li><b>Skin Abscesses:</b>You develop an abscess when bacteria get under the surface 
	of your skin. This type of abscess can develop anywhere on the body, including 
	the trunk, hands, underarms, feet, buttocks, and genitals. You may develop an 
	abscess when you have a skin wound which allows the bacteria to get into your skin. 
	You may also develop it because of a blocked sebaceous gland in your skin.</li>
    <li><b>Internal Abscesses:</b>You may develop abscesses inside the tummy mainly 
	due to an infection that reaches deep tissues in your body. This may happen due 
	to an abdominal surgery, an injury, or an infection spreading from a nearby area.</li>
  
</ul>

      <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

<div class="container">
There are no self-care options for abscesses. While waiting to see your doctor, 
you can try applying a warm compress to the affected area and take ibuprofen to 
help with the swelling and pain.

      <h2>When to seek Medical Care?</h2>
    </div>

<div class="container">
A worsening red, tender swelling should prompt you to make an appointment with your 
physician as soon as possible. If the area involves your face, is spreading rapidly, 
or is in an area that severely limits your functionality, you should seek emergency care.
</div>
</div>

      <h2>Treatments</h2>
    </div>

<div class="container">
Your doctor may drain the pus and fluid collection by making a small incision in the
 skin after it has been numbed. This will drain a majority of the bacteria, 
 helping the body fight the small amount that remains. This fluid may then be 
 sent to a laboratory for testing (culture), but not necessarily. The culture 
 can tell the doctor not only what type of bacterium is causing the infection
 but also what antibiotics will work best to treat it. This may take as little
 as 2 to 3 days. Your doctor may choose to have you start oral antibiotics aimed
 at treating the most common bacteria that cause abscesses while awaiting these 
 results. However, if the infection is small and it has been drained, your 
 doctor may decide to not treat you with oral antibiotics.<br><br>

If your symptoms are not improving or it is determined that the bacterium 
is not one of the common types, your doctor may prescribe different antibiotics.
 If your doctor prescribes antibiotics, it is important to take the entire 
 course as prescribed, even if you are feeling better or the infection appears 
 to be gone after just a few days. If you have been taking antibiotics and the 
 infection itself or the way you are generally feeling have not improved in 
 about 2 to 3 days, return to see your doctor.

      <h2>Preventing a skin abscess</h2>
    </div>

<div class="container">
Most skin abscesses are caused by bacteria getting into a minor wound, the 
root of a hair or a blocked oil or sweat gland.
Ensuring that your skin is clean, healthy and largely free of bacteria can help 
reduce the risk of skin abscesses developing.<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>washing your hands regularly</li>
    <li>encouraging people in your family to wash their hands regularly</li>
    <li>using separate towels and not sharing baths</li>
	<li>waiting until your skin abscess is fully treated and healed before using 
	any communal equipment, such as gym equipment, saunas or swimming pools</li>
    
</ul>

Don't squeeze the pus out of the abscess yourself, because this can easily spread 
the bacteria to other areas of your skin. If you use tissues to wipe any pus away 
from your abscess, dispose of them straight away to avoid germs spreading. Wash 
your hands after you've disposed of the tissues.<br><br>
Take care when shaving your face, legs, underarm areas or bikini area to avoid 
nicking your skin. Clean any wounds immediately and visit your GP or local NHS 
walk-in centre if you think there may be something trapped in your skin. Don't 
share razors or toothbrushes.

      <h2>Home Remedies for a Skin Abscess</h2>
    </div>

<div class="container">
<ul>
    <li>If the abscess is small (less than 1 cm or less than a inch across),
	applying warm compresses to the area for about 30 minutes, four times daily may help.</li>
    <li>Once the boil drains, it should heal on its own, though this may take several weeks.</li>
    <li>Do not attempt to drain the abscess by pressing on it. This can push the 
	infected material into the deeper tissues.</li>
	<li>Do not stick a needle or other sharp instrument into the abscess because it 
	may injure an underlying blood vessel or cause the infection to spread.</li>
