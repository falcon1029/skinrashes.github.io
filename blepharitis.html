      <h1>Blepharitis</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>What is Blepharitis?</h2>
Blepharitis is inflammation of the eyelids. When it involves the outside front 
of the eyelid, where the eyelashes are attached, it is called anterior blepharitis. 
Anterior blepharitis may be caused by:

<ul>
<li>Bacteria</li>
<li>Scalp dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis)</li>
<li>Allergy</li>
<li>Psoriasis</li>
</ul>
If blepharitis involves the inner eyelid, it is called posterior blepharitis. 
Posterior blepharitis may be caused by:
<ul>
<li>Dysfunction of the oil (meibomian) glands in the eyelid</li>
<li>Acne rosacea</li>
<li>Scalp dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis)</li>
<li>Allergy</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Although blepharitis is very common, people who have scalp dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis),
 dry skin, acne rosacea, contact allergies, diabetes, poor hygiene, or those sensitive 
 to chemical irritants or cosmetic makeup are much more likely to suffer from blepharitis.
 Blepharitis is not contagious.

      <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Typically, the eyelids are reddened ("red rims" as it is often called), swollen, and slightly warm, 
often with crusty debris (in the lashes, in the corner of the eyes, or on the lid edges).
 Burning, tearing, sensitivity to light, the feeling of a foreign body in the eye(s), 
 sticking together of the lids, watery or mucous discharge, pain, blurry vision, 
 and eye redness may all occur with blepharitis. Eye lashes may fall out or become 
 twisted and possibly irritate the eye. Blepharitis may affect only one eye, but, 
 usually, both eyes are involved.

      <h2>Diagnosing eyelid inflammation</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Your family doctor, an internist, or an eye doctor can diagnose eyelid inflammation.
 In some cases, a physical examination of your eye is enough to diagnose the condition. 
 Your doctor can also closely examine your eyelids using a specialized magnifying tool.
 This eye examination checks your eyes for inflammation as well as the presence of bacteria,
 fungi, or viruses, which can indicate an infection.
<br><br>
If there are symptoms of an infection, your doctor will swab your eye and take a sample 
of any fluid seeping from your eyes. This sample is then examined under a microscope.

      <h2>Types of eyelid inflammation</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
There are two types of eyelid inflammation:
<ul>
<li><b>Anterior eye inflammation</b>occurs on the outside of your eye where your eyelashes
 are located. Dandruff on your eyebrows and allergic reactions in your eyes can cause 
 anterior eyelid inflammation.</li>
<li><b>Posterior eyelid inflammation</b>occurs on the inner edge of eyelids closest to 
your eye. A malfunctioning oil gland behind your eyelash follicles usually 
causes this form of inflammation.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<p>
Washing your eyes and applying a warm compress can reduce inflammation. Depending
 on the severity of inflammation and whether your inflammation is caused by an 
 infection, your doctor may recommend other treatments.
</p>

<h3>Steroid treatment</h3>

<p>
If you don’t have an infection, your doctor may prescribe steroids, eye drops, or 
ointment to reduce inflammation. Your doctor may also prescribe lubricating eye 
drops to stop irritation caused by dry eyes.
</p>

<h3>Antibiotics</h3>

<p>
A course of antibiotics may effectively treat eyelid infections. Your doctor can 
prescribe antibiotic medication in pill, ointment, or liquid drop form. Doctors 
often prescribe drops when an infection spreads beyond the eyelid.
</p>

      <h2>Potential complications</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Eyelash loss is a potential complication of eyelid inflammation. This is caused 
by scarring in the hair follicles, which can make your lashes grow incorrectly. 
Extensive scarring can also prevent eyelash growth.
<br><br>
Common short-term complications of eyelid inflammation include dry eyes and pink eye. 
Long-term complications may include:

<ul>
<li>scarring on the eyelid</li>
<li>a stye (an infected lump that appears on the base of your eyelashes)</li>
<li>chronic pink eye</li>
</ul>
The oil glands on your eyelids can also become infected and blocked. This can cause 
an infection under your eyelids. An untreated eye infection can cause permanent eye 
damage and vision loss. Scarring under the eyelids can scratch the eye’s delicate 
surface. It can also cause ulcers on your cornea, which is the clear, protective 
outer layer of your eye.

      <h2>Preventing eyelid inflammation</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Eyelid inflammation can be uncomfortable, painful, and unsightly. Unfortunately,
 this condition isn’t always preventable, but you can take measures to reduce 
 your risk of inflammation.
<br><br>
Make sure you wash your face regularly. This includes removing your eye and facial 
makeup before going to bed. Don’t touch your eyes with dirty hands and don’t rub 
itchy eyelids. Rubbing your eyes can spread an existing infection. Also, have your
 eyelids checked if you notice pain, redness, or swelling. Controlling dandruff
 also helps reduce inflammation. If you have severe dandruff, talk with your doctor. 
 You may need a prescription shampoo.
