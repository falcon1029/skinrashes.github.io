        <h2>What is Chondrodermatitis Nodularis Helicis?</h2>

<p>
Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis (CNH) is a skin condition that affects 
the cartilage of the ear. It’s a painful nodule, which may or may not have a
 scab on it, that grows over a period of time. The nodule grows quickly, 
 typically measuring between 2 and 4 millimeters, and then stops growing, 
 but remains persistent.
<br><br>
Often the nodule appears on the ear on the side of the head that you sleep on.
 Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis is sometimes referred to as Winkler’s disease.
 Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis is not contagious and is most often found 
 in men over the age of 40. However, it can also be seen in women and younger patients.

      <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis can occur in most age groups and both sexes, 
but the typical patient is a middle-aged to elderly male with a significant 
history of sun exposure.

      <h2>Symptoms of chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis produces one defining symptom: the appearance 
of a raised bump (called a papule, or a nodule) on the ear. This bump is usually on
 the helix or antihelix of a person’s ear cartilage.
<br><br>
The nodule creates a sensation of pain or pressure when irritated, and it’s sensitive 
to the touch. Some people with CNH report episodes of stabbing pain at the area that
 last several hours.
<br><br>
The nodule often appears spontaneously. However, some patients may have preceding 
trauma, frostbite, or chronic sun damage prior to the appearance of this lesion. 
No poking or squeezing of the nodule will shrink or get rid of it, though it may 
bleed if you try to remove it.

      <h2>Causes of chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
People develop CNH for different reasons. Sometimes, it seems to develop for no 
reason at all. Some possible causes include:

<ul>
<li>sleeping consistently on one side, which can be a source of pressure or irritation on one ear</li>
<li>compromised blood supply to the cartilage</li>
<li>exposure to extreme cold weather</li>
<li>ear trauma due to continued use of headphones, telephones, or hearing aid devices</li>
<li>prolonged sun exposure throughout life, according to some theories</li>
</ul>
The skin condition is not contagious or caused by any sort of bacteria or virus. Men over 
the age of 40 are the most likely to develop CNH, but women get it, too. There have 
also been some rare cases reported of children experiencing CNH.
<br><br>
However, there is little research into the actual development of CNH. There is no evidence 
that CNH is contagious, and no bacteria or virus is connected with the appearance of CNH.

      <h2>How is chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis usually presents as a raised nodule on the 
parts of the ear cartilage referred to as the “helix” or the “antihelix.” These
 are the inner and outer ridges of cartilage in the ear. If you notice that a painful 
 nodule in your ear has appeared, you need to show it to your doctor. If you are in pain 
 and want a referral for a specialist, tell your doctor that you are experiencing CNH 
 symptoms and want to be examined for the condition.
<br><br>
A dermatologist may be able to guess what it is by looking at it. To be safe, you will 
probably need to get a biopsy to make sure that CNH is what’s causing the raised bump 
on your ear. The condition can be misdiagnosed or mistaken for skin cancer. Sometimes 
the skin around or on top of the nodule bleeds or becomes scaly. This makes it especially 
difficult to rule out malignancy without a biopsy first. Basal cell skin cancer, squamous 
cell skin cancer, and actinic keratosis (precancers) can all mimic a CNH.

      <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis can be prevented by avoiding pressure and repeated 
trauma to the affected ear. Positioning the head to the other side while sleeping as well 
as using the other ear when talking on the phone or using headsets can often lessen 
aggravation of the affected area.

      <h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
If a painful nodule on the ear is noted, seek evaluation by a primary care provider or 
dermatologist. A skin biopsy may be needed to rule out a certain type of skin cancer 
(squamous cell carcinoma).

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The most common treatment for CNH used to be surgery. The surgery attempts to remove 
the entire nodule from the person’s ear. During the excision surgery, nerves are sometimes 
cut to remove the painful sensations around the papule. Even after surgery, CNH may 
return in the same area of the ear. This is especially true if the surgery fails to 
completely remove all the inflamed cartilage underneath the nodule.
<br><br>
The recurrence rate after this type of surgery is around 10–30 percent, according to one study.
<br><br>
New studies have shown that more conservative treatments for CNH may have the same 
overall rate of recurrence. Because of this, it may be better to avoid surgery if possible.
 Alternatives to surgery can include:

 <ul>
<li>sleeping with a custom pillow made for people with CNH</li>
<li>applying a topical nitroglycerin treatment.</li>
<li>freezing the nodule with nitrogen</li>
<li>receiving laser or photodynamic therapy</li>
</ul>
 Sleeping with a custom pillow or foam prosthesis is one of the recommended methods of 
 treating the pain that comes from sleeping on the nodules. Specialty pillows that have 
 a hole in them where the ear would otherwise be flattened against the pillowcase are 
 sold specifically for people that have CNH. Some individuals feel that as long as they 
 are able to sleep and not feeling pain or pressure, that’s all the treatment that they 
 need for their CNH.
<br><br>
Another method of treatment is a topical nitroglycerin application. One study, which 
used a patch to apply the nitroglycerin to the nodule on the ear, had very successful 
results. This study indicated that the patch treatment, if continued over time, could 
improve blood flow to the area of the nodule and cause it to decrease in size.
<br><br>
Some dermatologists may choose to freeze the nodule with nitrogen or treat it with a 
series of cortisone injections. Laser treatment has also been used with some success.
<br><br>
Your personal medical history, your comfort level with different kinds of treatment 
strategies, and the treatment experience of your dermatologist are all taken into account
 when deciding how to treat your CNH.

      <h2>Outlook</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis can be a source of discomfort when you first 
become aware of it. This diagnosis can certainly be an inconvenience. However, 
it’s treatable by a dermatologist and doesn’t usually indicate anything more serious.
<br><br>
In the long term, the prognosis for dealing with CNH is good. Using conservative 
treatments such as custom pillows or nitroglycerin application, there’s a chance 
that you won’t be in any CNH pain. If concerns about the cosmetic appearance of your 
CNH arise, surgery is fairly straightforward and recovery is quick.
