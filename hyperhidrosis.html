<h2>What is hyperhidrosis?</h2>

<p>
    Hyperhidrosis means excessive sweating. It can be localised or affect the whole body.
<br><br>
    Sweating;
<br><br>
    Sweating is controlled by parts of the brain which send signals along nerves to the small sweat
    glands in the skin. These nerves are part of the “autonomic nervous system” which controls
    many unconscious body functions. Some of these functions, including sweating, are called “sympathetic”.
    (This is different from the everyday use of the word and does not suggest any emotional meaning).
<br><br>
    Increased sweating is a normal response to a rise in body temperature, and to emotions like anxiety.
<br><br>
    A treatment which reduces sweating is called an antiperspirant. This is different from a deodorant,
    which reduces odour, usually through an antibacterial effect. The two are often combined in the same product.

     <h2>What causes hyperhidrosis?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Localised symmetrical hyperhidrosis: the commonest type of hyperhidrosis, this affects certain body sites
    (localised), and both sides equally (symmetrical). The palms, the soles, the skin under the arms, the face
    and scalp, or combinations of these can be affected. The cause of this type is not known. It often begins
    in the teens, and tends to improve slowly as you get older. This type of hyperhidrosis is also called focal
    or primary hyperhidrosis.
<br><br>
    Generalised hyperhidrosis (affecting the whole body) can be caused by some illnesses including infections,
    and by some hormonal conditions including the menopause, diabetes and an overactive thyroid gland. This type
    of hyperhidrosis is called secondary hyperhidrosis. Some medicines can also cause excessive sweating,
    including fluoxetine (Prozac) and similar antidepressants. Sometimes no cause can be found.
<br><br>
    Disease or irritation of part of the sympathetic nerve pathway is a rare cause of increased sweating,
    either generally or in localised areas (usually on one side rather than both).
<br><br>
    Anxiety can trigger or worsen hyperhidrosis, but this does not necessarily mean that the affected person
    is unusually anxious or stressed.


<h3>Is hyperhidrosis hereditary?</h3>
<p>
    Hyperhidrosis is a feature of some rare inherited conditions. There is a trend for the common localised
    symmetrical type to run in families and up to a third of sufferers may have a family member with the condition.

     <h2>What are the symptoms of hyperhidrosis?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Visible sweat, wet clothes and a clammy handshake can be embarrassing, and can interfere with work and personal relationships.
<br><br>
    Hyperhidrosis affects the water-producing (“eccrine”) sweat glands, and not the “apocrine” sweat glands which produce
    the more oily type of sweat which causes odour, especially under the arms. Therefore bad odour is not a direct result
    of hyperhidrosis. However, if sweaty feet get soggy inside shoes, overgrowth of harmless skin bacteria can cause a bad smell.

     <h2>How will it be diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Your doctor will assess which kind of hyperhidrosis you have. Depending on the type, you might have tests for
    an infection, diabetes, thyroid overactivity or other conditions.

     <h2>Can hyperhidrosis be cured?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    When there is an underlying cause which can be treated, the hyperhidrosis can be cured. Surgical treatment can cure some people,
    but is often associated with side effects and is therefore considered only if other modalities have failed. Otherwise,
    the aim is to control the condition.

     <h2>How can it be treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Most people suffering from hyperhidrosis will have tried commercial
    antiperspirants. If these fail, and if the sweating is bad enough to interfere with
    your work or social activities, you should ask your doctor for advice. The
    doctor will assess whether there might be an underlying cause, and may start
    treatment. If necessary you may be referred to a dermatologist.



<h3>1.Localised hyperhidrosis</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Aluminium chloride </b>is the usual active ingredient in commercially
        available antiperspirants. Stronger preparations of aluminium chloride
        can be prescribed for excessive sweating, and are mostly used under
        the arms but can be used on the hands and feet. They should be
        applied at night only, to dry skin. However, sore red skin is a common
        problem. This can be reduced by making sure the skin is completely
        dry before applying the solution, by using hydrocortisone cream, and
        by using the treatment less frequently and then trying to build up. There
        are now newer aluminium chloride antiperspirants which contain aloe
        vera and cause less sensitivity.</li>
    <li><b>Formalin solutions </b>harden the skin and can block the tubes leading
        from sweat glands to the skin surface. They are suitable only for the
        soles of the feet and not commonly used nowadays.</li>
    <li><b>Solutions of the anticholinergic drug glycopyrrolate  </b>can reduce
        sweating in localised areas such as the scalp and forehead. However,
        this is rarely available on the NHS in the UK.</li>
    <li><b>Iontophoresis </b>is a method of passing a small electric current through
        areas of skin immersed in a dish of water. It is used for the armpits,
        palms and soles. It was originally developed as a way of getting
        glycopyrrolate into the skin. This can be effective, but can cause side
        effects. The same method using only water, without any added
        medication, is often helpful but without side effects. The treatment
        needs to be done regularly and lasts 10-20 minutes. Iontophoresis
        does tend to cause a tingling sensation; if this causes a problem then
        the current can be reduced. Equipment for home use can be bought for
        a few hundred pounds. Some hospitals offer a trial of the treatment so
        that you can see if it works for you.</li>
    <li><b>Botulinum toxin</b>derived from bacteria (one brand name is “Botox”) can
        be injected into the skin in very small carefully controlled doses to block
        the action of the nerves which activate the sweat glands. This
        treatment usually works very well, is quite widely available privately,
        but is only available in a few NHS centres in the UK. The effect usually
        lasts 2-6 months, although some patients may continue to benefit for
        12 months, and the treatment can be repeated. Botulinum toxin is only
        licensed for underarm sweating and not for large areas. The skin can
        be numbed with an anaesthetic cream or injection, but this is often not
        needed as underarm skin is not very sensitive. Botulinum toxin is not
        commonly used in the palms and soles because it can cause
        temporary weakness of hand and foot muscles and is painful. </li>
    <li><b>Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy </b> may be considered for localised
        hyperhidrosis when other treatments have failed. It is most useful for
        severe hyperhidrosis of the palms and face. This is a major operation,
        performed under general anaesthetic and which carries a number of
        risks. These include nerve and lung damage during the surgery, as well
        as the risks of any general anaesthetic. In addition, many patients go
        on to develop compensatory sweating at other body sites. In a
        proportion of patients this is more severe than the original problem and
        is very difficult to treat. Careful selection and counselling of patients
        before surgery is essential.</li>
    <li><b>Other surgical methods </b>apply only to the underarm skin, especially
        when only a small area is involved. They include the removal of a
        wedge of skin containing the overactive sweat glands, or the scraping
        away of the sweat glands from a flap of skin or from the underside of
        the skin through a small hole, which is then replaced.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<h3>2.Generalised hyperhidrosis </h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Generalised hyperhidrosis is too widespread to treat with lotions, injections
        or surgery. However, some medicines taken as tablets can reduce sweating.
        The most reliable are those which block the chemical signal between the
        nerves and the sweat glands. Propantheline is the only anticholinergic drug
        licensed for hyperhidrosis; however, although unlicensed, other
        anticholinergic drugs are widely used (such as oxybutynin and glycopyrrolate).
        Unfortunately, anticholinergics sometimes cause side effects including a dry
        mouth, blurred vision, tummy cramps, constipation, and difficulty in passing
        urine. They may be harmful for people with glaucoma and some other
        conditions. A small dose is used at first and gradually increased. Some people
        get relief from sweating before significant side effects occur, but for others the
        side effects begin before they reach a dose high enough to control sweating.
