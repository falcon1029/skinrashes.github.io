        <h2>What is Intertrigo?</h2>


<p>
Intertrigo is a fancy name for a rash that shows up between the folds of skin. It is a
 very common skin rash that can crop up throughout life.
<br><br>
The most common areas affected include larger skin-fold areas such as:
<ul>
<li>Armpits</li>
<li>Beneath the breasts</li>
<li>Genital area</li>
<li>Abdomen</li>
</ul>

     <h2>Causes of Intertrigo</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Intertrigo is an inflammatory skin condition that can be caused and worsened by many factors. 
These include:
<ul>
<li>Moisture</li>
<li>Heat</li>
<li>Lack of air circulation</li>
<li>Friction between skin folds</li>
</ul>
Sweat, urine, and feces can contribute to the skin problem.
<br><br>
Intertrigo is often accompanied by an infection caused by:
<ul>
<li>Yeast</li>
<li>Other types of fungus</li>
<li>Bacteria</li>
</ul>
You are more likely to get these infections in skin folds because these are areas that are 
warm and tend to stay moist. This creates a welcome environment for the growth of germs.

     <h2>Risk Factors for Intertrigo</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
You are more likely to develop intertrigo if you:

<ul>
<li>Are obese</li>
<li>Have diabetes</li>
<li>Have a splint, brace, or artificial limb</li>
<li>Are exposed to high heat and humidity</li>
</ul>
Other possible risk factors include:
<ul>
<li>Incontinence</li>
<li>Excessive sweating</li>
<li>Poor hygiene</li>
<li>Malnutrition</li>
<li>A suppressed immune system due to chemotherapy or HIV</li>
</ul>
Infants -- with their chubbiness, shorter necks, and flexed 
posture -- are also at greater risk for intertrigo.
<br><br>
Certain skin diseases such as psoriasis may also prompt the development of intertrigo. 
So it's a good idea to have a dermatologist check it out.

     <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Intertrigo is most commonly seen in skin fold areas. In people who are obese, 
the skin my become inflamed in neck creases, on the skin behind the knee or in 
front of the elbows, in the thigh and groin folds, or, less commonly, under the 
breast or belly folds. Redness and breaks in the skin (erosions) of opposing skin 
surfaces may be noted. The area may ooze or be sore or itchy.

     <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<ul>
<li>Gently cleanse the affected areas daily with mild soap substitutes.</li>
<li>Keep the areas dry and exposed to the air. If this is not easy to do, using 
absorbent cotton or fabric, as well as absorbent powders, may help (as long as 
fabrics are changed if they become damp). Mild antiperspirants may help, but 
these can cause further irritation in some individuals.</li>
<li>Barrier creams, such as zinc oxide paste, may be helpful for individuals 
wearing diapers or having incontinence problems.</li>
<li>If overweight, weight loss is recommended.</li>
<li>For persistent irritation, 0.5â€“1.0% hydrocortisone cream twice daily may help. 
Discontinue if you are no better after 2 weeks of use. Adding a topical antifungal
 to the hydrocortisone, such as clotrimazole cream, may help if yeast infection 
 is suspected. Apply the barrier paste (if used) after application of these creams.</li>
</ul>

     <h2>Treatment of Intertrigo</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<ul>
<li>Low-potency topical steroid creams.</li>
<li>Calcineurin inhibitors (pimecrolimus cream and tacrolimus ointment), which 
are non-steroid topical agents, can be helpful in difficult cases.</li>
<li>Coexisting infection should be treated if present. In cases with limited yeast 
involvement, topical miconazole, clotrimazole, or ciclopirox olamine may be used. 
If more severe yeast involvement is noted, oral antifungal agents, such as fluconazole,
 may be used. Topical or oral antibiotics may be needed for bacterial infections.</li>
<li>A biopsy may be recommended if the diagnosis is uncertain.</li>
</ul>
