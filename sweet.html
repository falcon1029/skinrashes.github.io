<h2>What is Sweet’s Syndrome?</h2>

<p>
    Sweet’s syndrome (also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is an uncommon skin disorder characterised
    by a fever and the appearance of tender red lumps on the skin. It is a reactive condition with a number of
    potential triggers. It is not contagious and cannot be transferred from one person to another.

    <h2>What causes Sweet’s Syndrome?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    In 50% of those affected it is not possible to identify a cause. Examples of causes include upper respiratory
    tract infections, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis and pregnancy. Sweet’s syndrome can also be
    caused by some medications and may be a sign of an underlying blood disorder or an internal cancer, but it is
    important to know that having Sweet’s syndrome does not mean that you definitely have one of these diseases.
    Sweet’s syndrome   may improve or resolve with treatment of the underlying condition.

    <h2>Is Sweet’s syndrome hereditary?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    It is very unusual for Sweet’s syndrome to affect more than one family member. In some of those cases a
    genetic link has been shown, but it is not normally a hereditary condition.
<br><br>
    What does Sweet’s syndrome of the skin look like?
<br><br>
    The most common skin changes in Sweet’s syndrome are raised red, pink or purplish tender skin lumps.
    These can be small (known as papules, which can be about 5-10 mm) or larger (known as nodules) and can
    join together to form bigger areas (known as plaques). They can be single or multiple and can appear
    anywhere on the skin although the arms, face and neck are affected most often. Sometimes blisters or
    pustules can be seen and the rash may appear at the site of an injury to the skin.

    <h2>What are the symptoms of Sweet’s syndrome?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Sweet’s syndrome may cause some or all of the following symptoms arising together over a period of hours or a few days:
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>a rash (described above)</li>
    <li>tiredness, lack of energy and feeling unwell</li>
    <li>high fever (temperature)</li>
    <li>aching joints and muscles</li>
    <li>mouth ulcers</li>
    <li>sore eyes</li>
</ul>
How will Sweet’s syndrome be diagnosed?<br><br>

Tests that are useful in Sweet’s syndrome include:<br><br>

A biopsy. This is the most important test. A sample is taken from a part of the skin involved
by the Sweet’s syndrome and then examined under the microscope.<br><br>

Blood tests such as a high white blood cell count can help make a diagnosis of Sweet’s syndrome.<br><br>

Your doctor may recommend other blood tests or x-rays to look for a cause of the Sweet’s syndrome.<br><br>

If a medication is thought to be responsible, your doctor may recommend stopping it for a while.

    <h2>Can Sweet’s syndrome be treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<p>Yes. Treatment is available for Sweet’s syndrome and it can improve quite quickly. Treatments can be divided
    into topical and oral medication.</p>
	
<h3>1.Local applications to the skin (topical treatments)</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>Strong steroid creams may help, especially with smaller lumps, and may help reduce the tenderness.
        Occasionally, steroid injections into the lesions can be used for very swollen or painful lumps.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>2.Oral  treatments</h3>

<p>
    <il>
        <li>Steroid tablets (e.g. prednisolone) can be a very effective treatment for Sweet’s syndrome.
            They are usually given at a higher dose to start with and then a lower dose may be given
            for a number of weeks to prevent the rash coming back.</li>
        <li>Oral therapy with dapsone, colchicine, potassium iodide or indomethacin can also be very
            effective and may be preferred by your doctor if you cannot take steroid tablets because
            of other medical problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure etc.</li>
        <li>Immunosuppressive agents (e.g. ciclosporin) reduce the action of the body’s own defence
            system (the immune system) and can also be very useful for treating Sweet’s syndrome.</li>
