<h2>What is a squamous cell carcinoma?</h2>

<p>
    There are two main categories of skin cancer: melanomas and non-melanoma skin cancers. Squamous cell carcinoma
    is one of the non-melanoma skin cancers. It is the second most common type of skin cancer in the UK.

    <h2>What causes a squamous cell carcinoma?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The most common cause is too much exposure to ultra-violet light from the sun or from sun beds. This causes certain
    cells (keratinocytes) in one of the layers of the skin (the epidermis) to grow out of control into a tumour.
<br><br>
    Squamous cell carcinomas can occur on any part of your body, but are most common on areas that are exposed to
    the sun, such as your head and neck (including the lips and ears) and the backs of your hands. Squamous cell
    carcinomas can also crop up where the skin has been damaged by X-rays, and also on old scars, ulcers, burns and
    persistent chronic wounds. Squamous cell carcinomas are not contagious.

    <h2>Who is most likely to have a squamous cell carcinoma?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Squamous cell carcinomas mainly affect the following groups:<br><br>

<ul>

    <li>Older people â€“ even those who tend to avoid the sun - but younger ones who are out in the sun a lot are at risk too. </li>
    <li>Builders, farmers, surfers, sailors and people who often use sun-beds can develop squamous cell carcinomas when
        they are quite young. </li>
    <li>Those with a fair skin are more likely to get them than people with a dark skin.</li>
    <li>Anyone who has had a lot of ultraviolet light treatment for skin conditions such as psoriasis will also be at
        increased risk of getting a squamous cell carcinomas. </li>
    <li>Those whose immune system has been suppressed by medication taken after an organ transplant, or by treatment
        for leukaemia or a lymphoma. </li>
    <li>People with skin conditions such as albinism and xeroderma
        pigmentosum that make them more susceptible to SCC.
    </li>

</ul>

    <h2>Are squamous cell carcinomas herditary?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    No, they are not; but some of the things that increase the risk of getting one, such as fair skin, a
    tendency to burn rather than tan, and freckling, do run in families.

    <h2>What does a squamous cell carcinoma look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    A squamous cell carcinoma usually appears as a scaly or crusty area of skin, with a red, inflamed base. Most small squamous
    cell carcinomas are not painful.

    <h2>How will my squamous cell carcinoma be diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    If your doctor thinks that the mark on your skin needs further investigation, you will be referred to a skin
    specialist who will decide whether or not it really is a squamous cell carcinoma. To confirm the diagnosis,
    a small piece of the abnormal skin (a biopsy), or the whole area (an excision biopsy), will be cut out and
    examined under the microscope. You will be given a local anaesthetic beforehand to numb the skin.
<h3>Can a squamous cell carcinoma be cured?</h3>
<p>
    Yes, squamous cell carcinomas can be cured if they are detected early. But if they are left untreated
    for too long, a few may spread to other parts of the body, and this can be serious and painfull.

    <h2>How can a squamous cell carcinoma be treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Surgery is usually the recommended treatment. This involves removing the
    SCC with a margin of normal skin around it, using a local anaesthetic. The
    skin is then closed with stitches or sometimes a skin graft is needed.
    Sometimes other surgical methods are used such as curettage and cautery.
    This involves scraping the SCC away using local anaesthetic.
    <br><br>
    Radiotherapy can also be used to treat SCC. This involves shining a beam of
    X-rays onto the skin. Usually several sessions are required.
    <br><br>
    For advanced SCC, a combination of treatments may be used. For SCC that
    has spread to other parts of the body a combination of surgery, radiotherapy
    and/or chemotherapy may be used.

    <h2>Self care (What can I do?)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Examining your skin on an intermittent basis is strongly advised. If you have
    any concerns you should see your General Practitioner or Dermatologist. In
    particular, look out for new lesions, lesions that are increasing in size or are
    changing in appearance and/or lesions which do not heal as expected and/or
    form a recurrent scab.
