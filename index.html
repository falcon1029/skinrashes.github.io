        <h2>What is Acne Exoriee?</h2>

Acne excoriee, also known as "picker's acne," results when acne lesions
are compulsively squeezed and scratched, resulting in scabs and scars. 
It is seen most commonly in adolescent girls and has been thought to be
 associated with underlying depression, anxiety, or emotional problems.
<br><br>
Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is thought to be caused by multiple 
factors. Overproduction of a normal oil on the skin, called sebum, 
increases under the influence of hormones. This, coupled with insufficient 
shedding of exfoliating dead skin cells, plugs hair follicles. 
The plugged follicle can become inflamed and have increased growth of 
normal skin bacteria, Propionibacterium acnes. Medications such as 
lithium, cortisone, hormones, iodides, some seizure medications, or 
isoniazid can also cause acne lesions.
<br><br>
Acne can result in permanent scarring, so minimizing breakouts is important.

       <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Acne results in a variety of lesions. The most common acne locations include 
the face, neck, chest, and back, where the most sebaceous glands are located. 
"Blackheads" (open comedones) and "whiteheads" (closed comedones) are 
follicular plugs that are either oxidized from being exposed to the air 
(blackhead) or sitting below the skin surface (whitehead). Papules are small
 pink to reddish-brown bumps; pustules are superficial pus-filled lesions, 
 and nodules or cysts are deeper pus-filled lesions.<br><br>

Mild acne consists of a few papules/pustules and/or comedones. Moderate acne 
has an increased number of lesions. Severe acne has numerous comedones, 
papules, and pustules and may have painful nodules.<br><br>

Picking can result in scabs, shallow sores, and permanent scars, which can 
either appear as depressions in the skin or hyperpigmentation, which is dark
 red or brown flat marks where the acne lesions were. The habit of picking 
 at the skin may persist long after the acne has improved.

       <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
There is no cure for acne. Acne can result in scarring, so minimizing 
breakouts is important.

Traditional treatments can help. Cleanse the acne-prone areas with 
gentle soaps or cleansers, and avoid irritants, such as rubbing and 
other alcohols, and abrasive scrubs and greasy products on the skin 
and in the scalp. Products labeled "water-based" or "noncomedogenic" 
will help reduce clogged pores.<br><br>

There are also a variety of over-the-counter medications that may help. 
These are meant to be preventative therapies and should be applied in a 
thin layer to the entire area on a regular basis. If applied consistently 
you may see small improvements quickly, but results are generally seen 
after a few months. Benzoyl peroxide (most effective), is available in a 
variety of forms and strengths. Benzoyl peroxides tend to dry the skin, 
though, so if you have dry skin, use a weaker-concentration product; for 
oily skin, consider higher strengths. It can also bleach your clothing and
 towels. Peeling agents (exfoliants) such as salicylic acid, sulfur, 
 resorcinol, and alpha-hydroxy acids (glycolic, lactic, pyruvic, and 
 citric acid) can also help but will cause some dryness of the skin as well.
<br><br>
In acne excoriee, the habit of picking at the skin must be stopped. This
habit may still persist after the acne has improved and may require 
behavioral therapy or counseling.

       <h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Seek professional care if you have moderate or severe acne that has not 
improved enough with self-care. Speak with your doctor if you have any 
feelings of depression or anxiety.

       <h2>Treatments</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Topical (or external) treatments include one or more creams, washes, or gels that include:
 <ul>
    <li>Antibiotics such as benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, erythromycin, sulfur, 
	sodium sulfacetamide, and azelaic acid.</li>
    <li>Retinoids  vitamin A-derived products such as tretinoin, tazarotene, and adapalene.</li>
  </ul>
Oral treatments may include:
<ul>
    <li>Antibiotics such as tetracycline, minocycline, doxycycline, erythromycin, ampicillin, 
	clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin, or cephalosporins.</li>
    <li>Oral contraceptives and spironolactone have been found to help regulate hormones.</li>
	<li>Isotretinoin, a strong drug with many side effects, for severe acne 
	unresponsive to the above treatments.</li>
  </ul>
Procedures:

<ul>
    <li>Special "blue light" treatments are a new way being investigated to treat acne 
	but are usually not covered by insurance.</li>
    <li>Several types of laser treatments also help acne and are often used with other 
	treatment methods; treatments are expensive, must be repeated for several months, 
	and have variable efficacy. Insurance may not cover laser therapy.</li>
	<li>Laser resurfacing, plastic surgery, and/or dermabrasion may help reduce 
	the prominence of old acne scars.</li>
  </ul>
  
  If there is evidence of excessive anxiety or depression, counseling may be suggested. 
  Sometimes, anti-anxiety or anti-depressant medication may be prescribed.
