<h2>What is rosacea? </h2>

<p>
    Rosacea is a common rash, found on the central part of the face, usually of a middle-aged person. A tendency to
    flush easily is followed by persistent redness on the cheeks, chin, forehead and nose, and by crops of small
    inflamed red bumps and pus spots.

     <h2>What causes rosacea?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The cause of rosacea is not fully understood, but many think that the defect lies in the blood vessels in the
    skin of the face, which dilate too easily. Rosacea is more common in women than in men, and in those with a
    fair skin who flush easily.<br><br>

    Many things seem to make rosacea worse, but probably do not cause it in the first place. They include alcohol,
    too much exercise, both high and low temperatures, hot spicy foods, stress, and sunlight. Things that stir up
    one personâ€™s rosacea may well have no effect at all on the rosacea of someone else. The idea that rosacea is due
    to germs in the skin, or in the bowel, has not been proved. Rosacea is not catching.


<h3>Is rosacea hereditary?</h3>
<p>
    Rosacea does seem to run in some families but it is still not clear whether heredity plays a big part in this.
</p>

<h3>What are the symptoms of rosacea?</h3>
<p>
    The skin of the face feels sensitive, and can burn or sting. Flushing (the face becomes bright red) adds to the
    embarrassment caused by the rash. Be sure to consult your doctor if you have problems with your eyes (see below).

     <h2>What does rosacea look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Rosacea starts with a tendency to blush and flush easily. After a while, the central areas of the face become a
    deeper shade of red and end up staying this colour all the time. The area becomes studded with small red bumps
    (papules) and pus spots, which come and go in crops. Small dilated blood vessels (telangiectasia) appear,
    looking like thin red streaks. Scarring is seldom a problem.<br><br>

    Other problems with rosacea include the following:<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>Rosacea can lead to embarrassment, anxiety, or depression, and a disrupted social life.</li>
    <li>The face may swell (lymphoedema), especially around the eyes.</li>
    <li>The nose may grow big, red and bulbous (rhinophyma) due to the overgrowth of the sebaceous glands.
    This is more common in men than women.</li>
    <li> Some people with rosacea have eye symptoms (red, itchy, sore eyes and eyelids; a gritty feeling;
    sensitivity to light). A few patients with rosacea have more serious eye problems, such as rosacea keratitis, that can interfere with vision.</li>

</ul>

     <h2>How will rosacea be diagnosed? </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Your doctor will recognise rosacea just by looking at your skin. There are no diagnostic laboratory tests.
    Rosacea differs from acne in that the skin is not extra-greasy; blackheads and scarring are not features;
    flushing is common; and there is a background of red skin.
<h3>Can rosacea be cured?</h3>
<p>
    No treatment can be guaranteed to switch rosacea off forever. However long-term treatments control symptoms and
    can clear the spots. Treatment works best if started when rosacea is at an early stage.

     <h2>How can rosacea be treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<p>
    The inflammation that accompanies rosacea can be treated with preparations applied to the skin or taken by mouth;
    however, these will not help the redness or blushing that may be associated with rosacea.
</p>
<h3>Local applications:</h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>The inflammatory element of mild to moderate rosacea may be controlled with a topical preparation (one that is applied to the skin).</li>
    <li>Useful preparations include metronidazole and azelaic acid. It takes at least 8 weeks for their effect to become evident. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Oral antibiotics:</h3>
<p>
    These are helpful for the inflammatory element of moderate or severe rosacea. The most commonly used antibiotics
    belong to the tetracycline group and include tetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline, lymecycline and minocycline.
    Erythromycin is another commonly used antibiotic. The duration of an antibiotic course depends on your response.
    Your doctor may suggest that you use a topical and oral treatment together.
</p>
<h3>Other treatments:</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>An eye specialist should manage the more severe types of eye involvement.</li>
    <li>A bulbous nose affected by rhinophyma can be reduced surgically.</li>
    <li>Redness and dilated blood vessels can be treated with laser therapy.</li>
    <li>A topical treatment called Brimonidine gel can help reduce the redness.</li>
    <li>A beta-blocker tablet or clonidine may help if blushing is a significant problem.</li>
    <li>Isotretinoin tablets are sometimes prescribed for severe rosacea.</li>

</ul>

     <h2>Self Care (What can I do?)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<ul>
    <li>Protect your skin from the sun by using a sun block (with a sun protection factor of at least 30) on your face every day.</li>
    <li>Do not rub or scrub your face as this can make rosacea worse.</li>
    <li>Do not use perfumed soap as this can make rosacea worse.</li>
    <li>Use a soap substitute (emollient) to cleanse your face.</li>
    <li>Use an unperfumed moisturiser on a regular basis if your skin is dry or sensitive.</li>
    <li>Consider the lifestyle factors that can worsen rosacea (listed above). Learn which upset your rosacea and avoid them; a written
        record of your flare-ups may help.</li>
    <li>Cosmetics can often cover up rosacea effectively, and some rosacea patients may benefit from the use of skin camouflage.
        This may help hide excessive redness. A health care professional will be able to make a referral for you if necessary.</li>
    <li>Unless they are specifically recommended to you by your doctor it may be best to avoid some treatments for acne,
        as they can irritate skin that is prone to rosacea.</li>
    <li>Do not use topical preparations containing corticosteroids, unless specifically recommended by your doctor,
        as these may make rosacea worse in the long run.</li>
    <li>If your eyes are giving problems, do not ignore them - consult your doctor.</li>
    <li>Some drugs can aggravate blushing, and your doctor may make appropriate changes to your medication.</li>
