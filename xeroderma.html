<h2>What is Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP)?</h2>

<p>
    XP is a very rare condition with about 100 patients living with it in the UK. The
    genetic material in the skin is unable to repair itself correctly after exposure to
    ultraviolet radiation (UVR) which is present in all forms of daylight and some
    artificial light (see section ‘light bulbs’). Without this repair mechanism working
    correctly a person is much more likely to develop skin cancers of all types. XP
    can be divided into different types known as complementation groups A to G
    and Variant. There are slight clinical differences between the groups; some
    are known to develop neurological problems such as hearing loss, balance
    problems or learning (cognitive) difficulties.

    <h2>What causes XP?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    XP is genetic; a person is born with it. Even though it might not be diagnosed
    until a person is older, they would have had it since birth and they will always
    have it.

    <h2>Is XP hereditary?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Yes it is. It is an autosomal recessive condition. This means a person with XP
    would need to inherit one copy of the XP gene from each parent. The parents
    are known as carriers as they only carry one copy of the XP gene and
    therefore do not themselves have XP. Parents often have no idea they carry
    the XP gene, however once it is known that they do, they are advised that
    there is a 1 in 4 risk in every further pregnancy of having a child with XP. XP
    can affect both sexes and all racial groups. Genetic counselling and advice is
    available to people with XP and parents of children with XP.

    <h2>What are the symptoms of XP?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    A person can have some or all of the following:

<ul>
    <li>Easy sunburning even on an overcast and cloudy day. This sunburn
        can often take up to 10 days or longer to get better.</li>
    <li>Sore or red eyes especially on a bright day (photophobia), watery eyes.</li>
    <li>Freckling (lentigines) on sun exposed sites. This freckling is often
        reported from an early age, (under the age of 2) and is unrelated to
        skin colour.</li>
    <li>Early onset of skin aging, dry skin</li>
    <li>Risk of skin cancers or eye cancers from early childhood or multiple
        numbers and types of skin cancer in a person.
    </li>
    <li>History of neurological problems such as hearing loss, poor balance
        and learning difficulties.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

    <div class="header">
    <h2>How is XP diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    If XP is suspected, a small skin biopsy can be taken from a non-sun exposed
    site, often the buttock. After a person has given their consent, the biopsy site
    would be made numb by injecting some local anaesthetic into the skin and
    removing a small piece of skin. This would be sent to the diagnostic laboratory
    to be tested. Results can take up to 4 months as it is a very complicated
    laboratory test.<br><br>
    The XP group can then be diagnosed with a blood test which would be sent to
    a genetic laboratory.

    <h2>Can XP be cured?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    At present there is no known cure for XP. However a person can do a lot to
    help themselves, especially in reducing the chances of skin cancers
    developing. This is explained in the ‘Self care, what can I do?’ section.

    <div class="header">
    <h2>How can XP be treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    It is recommended someone diagnosed with XP should have:
    <ul>
    <li>Skin checks by a dermatologist who looks for early signs of any skin
        cancers. This can reduce the risk of them spreading and causing
        further harm. If there are any concerning skin lesions these can be
        biopsied and surgically removed. In some cases topical treatments
        (creams to skin) may be prescribed which can help treat some early
        signs of skin cancers.</li>
    <li>Eye checks by an ophthalmologist who looks for eye damage
        associated with UVR. Sometimes eye lubricants are prescribed to treat
        dryness. Various types of glasses may be suggested to reduce UVR
        damage and in some cases, surgery may be recommended if there are
        any suspicious areas, which could indicate eye cancer, although this is
        rare.
    </li>
    <li>The minority of people with XP who show signs of balance problems or
        learning difficulties or a loss of skills they previously had can benefit
        from seeing a neurologist (a doctor skilled in problems of the nerves
        and brain). They would examine the patient and take a detailed history
        and may also suggest a MRI (brain scan), hearing test and/or nerve
        conduction study. These will help them understand the extent of the
        problem so they can give advice. This advice may include things such
        as organising help at school to maximise a child’s learning potential,
        hearing aids if required, better footwear to help walking.
    </li>
    <li>It can sometimes be hard to understand and adapt to live with XP; it
        can help to have access to a psychologist who patients can talk to in
        confidence about their feelings. They may be able to give suggestions
        as to what may be helpful to that person.</li>
    <li>If a patient is protecting themselves from UVR then Vitamin D levels in
        their blood can be low, due to lack of sunlight which is needed to help
        the body produce this vitamin. Vitamin D levels can be checked with a
        simple blood test and supplements prescribed if required. Low vitamin
        D could lead to bone pain and long term bone problems.
    </li>
</ul>
Once a person has been diagnosed with XP, it is suggested that they are
referred to the National XP service based at St Thomas’ Hospital in London.
This service is funded by NHS England. They will work in partnership with the
patient’s referring Doctor, giving advice as necessary. If the person is able
and willing to travel to the London clinic, they will see lots of different
speciality doctors in one day: e.g. dermatology, neurology, ophthalmology,
psychology and genetics. The XP specialist nurse is available to give advice
on all matters of protection from UVR. They can visit families in their home,
school or workplace if requested.

    <h2>Self care (What can I do?)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Protection from UVR is very important to help reduce any further damage to
    your skin. UVR is present at the same time as daylight, from the moment the
    sun comes over the horizon to when it falls at night. UVR is part of the
    electromagnetic spectrum but unlike sunlight, it is invisible. Although there is
    less UVR present when it is cloudy or rainy, it is still there and therefore a
    person would still need to protect themselves in the following ways all year
    round, whatever the weather.
    <br><br>
    Think about when to go outside. UVR levels are highest when the sun is
    directly overhead. UVR is not present outside at night and therefore no extra
    precautions would be needed. Understandably people have to be able to go
    out during the day but avoiding the highest UVR levels would be advised. In
    addition there are a number of other protective steps recommended.

    <ul>
    <li><b>Clothing </b>to cover the whole body including long sleeves and long
        trousers to protect the arms and legs and gloves to protect the hands.
        Tight weave materials let through less UVR and thick clothing or
        multiple layers can block UVR completely. Some manufacturers
        produce clothing to protect from UVR and this is marked with a 50+
        UDF (a measure of how much UVR a material lets through) label,
        these can help, but can be expensive. Some people opt to wear two
        thinner layers of clothing instead.</li>
    <li><b>Hat </b>with a wide brim that covers the forehead, ears and neck for
        example a legionnaire’s style hat.
    </li>
    <li><b>Sunglasses </b>to protect the eyes with a high UVR protection rating to
        protect against UVA and UVB wavelengths. If a person prefers clear
        non-tinted glasses these can now be bought with UVA and UVB
        coating. The style of glasses that wrap around the face or have side
        covers to limit UVR reaching the eye are suggested.</li>
    <li><b>UVR Protective face visor </b>s very good for full protection of the face.
        Pictures of this can be found on the XP Support Group (XPSG) and
        Teddington Trust websites below, along with details on how to get one
        or make one.
    </li>
    <li><b>Sunscreen </b>should be broad spectrum 50+ sun protective factor (SPF)
        which protects against UVB as well as UVA. Sunscreens come in a
        variety of forms, sprays, creams, lotions, gels, roll-on along with
        different smells and colours/tints. It is important to choose one that a
        person will be happy to use all the time. Some are available on
        prescription for people with XP. Sunscreen should be applied 20
        minutes before going out, and should be reapplied 2-3 hourly. Reapply
        the sunscreen if the cream is removed, e.g. after hand washing. Care
        should be taken in application to ensure no areas are missed and the
        correct amount is used. Sunscreen is tested for its SPF rating by
        testing with 2 mg/cm2 so if using a lotion, this equates to six heaped
        teaspoons of lotion or 35 ml to cover an adult body. This can vary if
        using different formulations so check the manufacturer’s
        recommendations. Lips should not be forgotten, SPF 50+ protection
        lipblock should also be used.
    </li>
    <li><b>Skin checks. </b>If you notice anything different on your skin or a freckle
        or mole looks like it is changing in some way then make an
        appointment to see your doctor or local dermatologist to get it checked
        out. The sooner something is noticed and treated the better. Your
        dermatologist/GP or specialist nurse can teach you what to look for and
        how to do a skin check.</li>
    <li><b>Eye concerns.</b>If you notice any changes with your eyes or notice any
        lumps, inform your medical team as soon as possible to get them
        checked.
    </li>
    <li><b>Environment.</b>UVR, in particular UVA, can travel through some
        window glass, although not all. It all depends on how the glass was
        manufactured which can be difficult to know if it is already in a window.
        UVR protective film is a transparent film that can be applied to a
        window to reduce UVA coming through. It is available from companies
        that supply window films and can be up to 99.8% effective at blocking
        UVA</li>
    <li><b>Light bulbs.</b>In particular, halogen, fluorescent and compact
        fluorescent bulbs are known to produce some UVA. This risk is
        relatively low but can be a problem if a bulb is close to a person with
        XP. Bulbs can be covered with protective UVR sleeves or changed to
        ones that produce less UVR such as LEDs.</li>
    <li><b>UV meter.</b>As UVR is invisible it can be hard to know when you are at
        risk. A UV meter, available to those seen in the UK National XP
        service, can help with a more accurate assessment of the amount of
        UVR in the environment.
