        <h2>What is Tinea Faciei?</h2>


<p>
Tinea faciei is a superficial infection of the skin. It is part of the<b> dermatophyte skin
 infections</b> and it can affect people of different sexes and ages. In children and in women,
 tinea faciei affects the skin on the face, including the chin and the upper lip. In the 
 male population, this infection is known as <b>tinea barbae,</b> as it occurs only on areas that
 have hair (such as the beard area).
<br><br>
What happens is that the <b>dermatophytes</b> (which are actually <b>keratinophilic fungi</b>) will release 
enzymes (known as keratinases). These enzymes are going to invade the upper layer of the 
epidermis, causing the lesions on the skin and an inflammatory reaction. Tinea faciei 
occurs all over the world but it has a higher frequency in the tropical regions. This is
 because the high temperatures and the constant humidity are considered to be triggering factors.

    <h2>What are the Symptoms of Tinea Faciei?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The most common locations for facial ringworm include the following:
<ul>
<li>Cheeks</li>
<li>Nose</li>
<li>Around the eye</li>
<li>Chin</li>
<li>Forehead</li>
</ul>
Facial ringworm appears as one or more pink-to-red scaly patches ranging in size from 1 to 5 cm.
 The border of the affected skin may be raised and may contain bumps, blisters, or scabs. Often, 
 the center of the lesion has normal-appearing skin with a ring-shaped edge, leading to the 
 nickname "ringworm," even though it is not caused by a worm.

Facial ringworm can be itchy, and it may get worse or feel sunburned after exposure to the sun.

    <h2>What are the Causes of Tinea Faciei?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
These are the most common causes of tinea faciei:
<br><br>
<b>Fungal infection </b>– zoophilic dermatophytes (Microsporum canis)
<ul>
<li>Acquired infection from pets or livestock</li>
<li>Transmission from one person to the other is possible, as the lesions are highly 
contagious to the touch</li>
<li>In Asia – common infections with Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum</li>
<li>In North America – common infection with Trichophyton tonsurans.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Facial ringworm may occur in people of all ages, of all races, and of both sexes. However, 
it is more common in warmer, more humid climates. In addition, it is most frequently 
seen in adults aged 20–40.
<br><br>
People with suppressed immune systems (eg, with diabetes, leukemia, or HIV/AIDS) are more 
likely to develop facial ringworm or to have more severe forms of the disease.

    <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<p>
These are the most common methods used for the diagnosis of tinea faciei:
</p>

<h3>1.Mycological investigation</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Microscopic examination of the skin</li>
<li>Skin cultures (surface scraping)
<ul>
<li>Keratinocytes will dissolve and the fungal elements are going to be exposed</li>
<li>The cultures allow for the positive identification of the fungal infectious agent</li>
<li>Special media can be used for faster detection of the dermatophytes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>2.Histological examination</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Used sometimes for the confirmation of the diagnosis</li>
<li>Histological modifications resembles the ones from psoriasis</li>
<li>Cutaneous fungal elements will be revealed in the epidermis</li>
<li>Certain fungal infectious agents might also infect the hair follicle 
(aspect revealed through histological examination)Chin</li>
<li>Infiltratory inflammation might be present in the dermis as well</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>3.Differential diagnosis</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Cutaneous infection with Candida</li>
<li>Allergic contact dermatitis</li>
<li>Irritant contact dermatitis</li>
<li>Perioral dermatitis</li>
<li>Seborrheic dermatitis</li>
<li>Granuloma</li>
<li>Lupus erythematosus (acute/bullous/discoid/drug-induced/sub-acute cutaneous/neonatal)</li>
<li>Pityriasis (alba/rosea)</li>
<li>Rosacea</li>
<li>Sarcoidosis</li>
<li>Syphilis.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Is tinea Faciei contagious?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Tinea Faciei is contagious. The infection is spread through close contact with an 
infected person, or by sharing towels, beds and other furniture with someone who is infected.
 It's also possible to catch ringworm from infected animals such as dogs, cats, horses or 
 farm animals.The fungus can live for long periods of time in the environment and therefore 
 infection can occur many months later.
</div>
</div>


<div class="card">
    <div class="header">
    <h2>Can tinea Faciei be cured?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Yes. It can be cured if treated adequately as it is an infection. However, in 
order to prevent re-infection, other family members and close contacts may need 
to be checked to make sure they are not carrying the infection.

    <h2>Treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<h3>1.Topical treatment</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Anti-fungal medication</b>
<ul>
<li>Recommended if the hair follicles are not affected</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><b>Topical corticosteroids</b> can be recommended to reduce the inflammation and itchiness</li>
<li><b>Ciclopirox/terbinafine</b>
<ul>
<li>Recommended for the anti-inflammatory properties</li>
<li>Given as treatment in cases of tinea faciei caused by zoophilic dermatophytes</li>
<li>Can reduce the common, yet severe, inflammatory reaction commonly associated with this condition</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><b>Azoles</b>
<ul>
<li>Topical application as well</li>
<li>Have a direct effect on the wall of the fungal cell</li>
<li>Reduces the reproduction of the fungal cells</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><b>Allylamines</b>
<ul>
<li>Leads to the death of fungal cells</li>
<li>Topical and systemic administration</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><b>Isoconazole nitrate</b> in combination with diflucortolone valerate
<ul>
<li>The combination of these two topical preparations has shown promising 
results in reducing the symptoms of tinea faciei</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<br><br>
More severe cases can benefit from systemic administration of corticosteroids. 
However, these should not be administered for prolonged periods of time, as they can 
have serious consequences on a person’s health and they can cause severe withdrawal symptoms. 
The treatment with systemic corticosteroids should be reduced gradually, not stopped 
all of a sudden
<br><br>
Systemic therapy is recommended in the following cases:
<ul>
<li>Rare, atypical lesions</li>
<li>Chronic cases</li>
<li>Multiple lesions.</li>
</ul>

</p>

    <h2>Other Self-Care Options</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
If you suspect that you have facial ringworm, you can try one of the following over-the-counter 
antifungal creams or lotions:
<ul>
<li>Terbinafine</li>
<li>Clotrimazole</li>
<li>Miconazole</li>
</ul>
Apply the cream to each lesion and to the normal-appearing skin 2 cm beyond the border of the 
affected skin for at least 2 weeks until the lesions are completely gone. Because ringworm is
 very contagious, avoid contact sports until lesions have been treated for at least 48 hours.
<br><br>
Since people often have tinea infections on more than one body part, examine yourself for other
 ringworm infections, such as in the groin (tinea cruris), on the feet (tinea pedis, athlete's foot),
 and anywhere else on the body (tinea corporis).
<br><br>
Have any household pets evaluated by a veterinarian to make sure that they do not have a fungal 
(ie, dermatophyte) infection. If the veterinarian discovers an infection, be sure to have the 
animal treated.
