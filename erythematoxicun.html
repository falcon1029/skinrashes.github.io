        <h2>What is Erythema Toxicum Neonatorum?</h2>


<p>
Erythema toxicum neonatorum (also known as toxic erythema of the newborn) 
is a harmless red rash that appears on the skin of newborns. This rash goes 
away on its own and has no symptoms. It has often been likened to the 
appearance of a fleabite on the skin. Erythema toxicum is an extremely 
common rash that does not require any treatment, as it will spontaneously 
go away in 5–7 days. The cause of this rash is unknown.

      <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Approximately 50% of full-term newborns develop erythema toxicum shortly 
after birth, most commonly seen on the second day of life. Preterm infants 
are less commonly affected; however, they may develop erythema toxicum at a
 week of life. It is also uncommon in infants who weight less than 5.5 
 pounds at birth. The rash does not appear to be seen more often in any 
 particular sex or race.

      <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Erythema toxicum appears as small (1–3 mm), firm, yellow or white raised bumps 
filled with pus on top of a red area of skin. There may be a few to many lesions, 
and they may be found on any area of the body, with the exception of palms and 
soles. Erythema toxicum often begins on the face and spreads, and it may be 
clustered in areas where there is pressure on the skin. Although it most frequently 
appears during the first 3–4 days of life, erythema toxicum can be seen at birth
 and may not be present until 10 days of life. New lesions may appear as older 
 ones resolve.

      <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
There is nothing that needs to be done for this rash; it will resolve 
in a few days to a week. Do not pop the pus-filled bumps, as irritating 
the rash may lead to an infection.

      <h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Because erythema toxicum occurs similar to many infectious disease rashes,
 including those caused by the herpes virus or other bacteria or fungi, 
 if you are unsure, you should consult your infant's pediatrician immediately.

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Your child's pediatrician will likely not prescribe any medication for this 
skin condition. If the pediatrician is not certain about the diagnosis, he/she 
may take a sample of pus from the lesions and look at the cells under a microscope. 
This helps in making the diagnosis. Furthermore, a blood test to look for a 
certain population of cells (eosinophils) may aid in the diagnosis, although 
this is not a confirming test and not commonly done.
