<h2>What is extra-mammary Paget’s disease?</h2>

<p>
    Extra-mammary Paget’s disease (EMPD) is a rare, slow-growing disease that is usually due to a pre-invasive type of
    skin cancer. Usually it is confined to the skin, but in approximately 20% of the cases it can be associated with an
    invasive cancer more deeply. It typically looks similar to a patch of eczema. It usually affects skin in the genital
    area and around the anus of both males and females. <br><br>
    It is commonest in people aged between 50-60 years. It can be primary,
    when its origin is in the skin, or secondary, when it comes from other adjacent regions internally like urethra, cervix,
    bladder or bowel. Paget’s disease, in contrast, refers to the same type of changes affecting the breast or nipple.
    There is no relation to another disease called Paget’s disease of the bone.

     <h2>What are the symptoms?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The most common symptom is itching in the affected skin. Often patients report a history of chronic itching over years
    which has failed to respond to moisturisers or topical steroid creams. Pain and bleeding may occur, particularly if
    the skin is scratched. Sometimes there are no symptoms at all.

     <h2>What does extra-mammary Paget’s disease look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The rash of EMPD can look like eczema, with red, flaky or sometimes weeping patches. The skin surface may become
    thickened with white raised areas. The rash is usually on the outer lips (labia) of the vulva in women and the
    penis or scrotum in men, but it can spread backwards to the perineum and anus. It may be on one side or both
    sides of anogenital skin.

     <h2>How is it diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The diagnosis is made by skin biopsy. This is a simple procedure in which a small sample of the lesion is removed
    under local anaesthesia to be analysed by a pathologist. Some special staining techniques may be needed in order
    to give more information on the type of cells involved.

     <h2>What other tests will I need?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    In a small number of cases EMPD can be associated with other cancers, and further tests to look for these may be required.
    For example, ultrasound scans of lymph nodes, or if EMPD is present around the anus your doctor will usually arrange
    for bowel investigations. If EMPD is present around the opening to the bladder (urethra) then your bladder may be investigated.

     <h2>What is the treatment?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The usual treatment is local surgical excision; however, recurrence is frequent. The
    excision should be wide enough to get a disease-free margin, usually 1.5 to 2 cm away
    from the visible lesion. There is no need to remove the lymph nodes in the groin, if
    there is no invasion.<br><br>
    Other medical treatments mainly used if required for recurrences include:
    <br><br>
    Imiquimod cream, which encourages the immune system to destroy the abnormal
    cells. Radiotherapy, laser and a form of light treatment (photodynamic therapy) can
    also be used.
