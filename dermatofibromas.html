        <h2>What are Dermatofibromas?</h2>


<p>
Dermatofibromas are small, non-cancerous growths on the skin. The skin has several 
layers, including the fat cells, epidermis, and dermis. When the cells of the dermis 
layer overgrow, dermatofibromas can develop. According to NYC Langone Medical Center, 
dermatofibromas are very common and usually not connected to skin cancer. It is 
common for people who develop dermatofibromas to have more than one growth on their 
body. They do not cause any negative health effects and are not painful 
(NYC Langone Medical Center).

      <h2>What Causes Dermatofibromas?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Dermatofibromas are caused by an overgrowth of cells in the dermis layer of the skin. 
The reasons why the overgrowth occurs are not known. The growths often develop after
 some type of trauma to the skin.

      <h2>Risk Factors For Dermatofibromas</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
It appears that the overgrowth of skin cells may be related to trauma to the skin. 
An injury, such as an insect bite or cut, may increase a person’s chances of developing 
the growth. Age is another risk factor. Dermatofibromas occur mostly in adults. 
According to the NYC Langone Medical Center, women are also more likely to develop 
the growths then men.

      <h2>Symptoms of Dermatofibromas</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Apart from the bumps on the skin, dermatofibromas rarely cause additional symptoms.
 The growths are normally reddish or brown. They are usually between 3 and 10 
 millimeters wide, although they can be larger. Dermatofibromas are also usually 
 firm to the touch. They can also be mildly sensitive to the touch.
<br><br>
The growths can occur anywhere on the body, but appear more often on exposed areas, 
such as the legs and arms.

      <h2> Dermatofibromas Diagnosis</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
A diagnosis is usually made after a physical exam. A trained dermatologist can 
usually identify a growth through a visual examination. Additional testing can 
include a skin biopsy to rule out other conditions, such as skin cancer.

      <h2>How Are Dermatofibromas Treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Dermatofibromas do not go away on their own. Because they are harmless, treatment 
is usually solely for cosmetic reasons.
<br><br>
There are currently no treatments that can shrink the growths. Common methods of 
removal include freezing (with liquid nitrogen), surgical excision, and shaving 
to flatten the growth.
<br><br>
Removal of a growth should never be attempted at home. This can lead to infection, 
scaring, and excess bleeding.

    </div>

    <div class="container">
Since the growths are almost always harmless, the condition does not negatively
 affect a person’s health. Removal methods, such as freezing and excision, have 
 varying degrees of success.  In some cases, the growths can grow back.

    <div class="container">
Researchers do not currently know why the overgrowth of skin occurs in some 
people. Because the cause in unknown, there is no way to prevent dermatofibromas
 from developing.
