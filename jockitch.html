        <h2>What is a Jock Itch (Tinea Cruris)?</h2>


<p>
<b>Tinea cruris,</b> most commonly known as <b>jock itch,</b> is a fungal infection of the skin. 
It belongs to a group of fungal skin infections called tinea. Like other tinea infections,
 jock itch is caused by mold-like fungi, which are known as dermatophytes. 
 These microscopic fungi naturally live on the skin as well as on the hair and nails. 
 They’re typically harmless, but they can multiply quickly and cause infections when 
 they’re allowed to thrive in warm, moist areas. This is why jock itch usually develops
 in the skin around the groin, inner thighs, and buttocks.
<br><br>
Jock itch is most common in men and adolescent boys. The infection causes a rash that 
often itches or burns. The affected areas can also be red, flaky, or scaly.
<br><br>
Though jock itch can be bothersome, it’s typically a mild infection. Treating it quickly 
will minimize symptoms and keep the infection from spreading. Most people find relief 
simply by applying topical antifungal medications and by keeping the affected area clean
 and dry.

     <h2>Causes of Jock Itch (Tinea Cruris)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Jock itch is caused by a group of fungi called <b>dermatophytes.</b> These fungi naturally 
live on your skin and normally don’t cause problems. However, when you remain in 
sweat-soaked clothes after exercising, the lengthy exposure to moisture can allow the 
fungi to multiply quickly. When you have an overgrowth of dermatophytes in your groin area, 
it causes the infection known as jock itch.
<br><br>
The fungus that causes jock itch is highly contagious. You may get the fungal infection 
through close personal contact with an infected person or through contact with the unwashed 
clothing of an infected person.
<br><br>
The term “jock itch” may give the impression that only athletes develop the infection, 
but it can occur in anyone. Those who are overweight are more likely to experience jock 
itch because the fungus can thrive in folds of skin, which are prone to sweating. 
As a preventive measure, it’s important to wash with soap and water in your groin and 
armpit areas daily. Jock itch may also be triggered by prolonged exposure to moisture 
and friction from clothes.

     <h2>Symptoms of jock itch</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Common symptoms of jock itch include:

<ul>
<li>redness in the affected area</li>
<li>persistent itching in the affected area</li>
<li>burning sensation in the affected area</li>
<li>flaking, peeling, or cracking skin in the affected area</li>
<li>a rash that gets worse with exercise or activity</li>
<li>changes in skin color</li>
<li>a rash that doesn’t improve or even worsens or spreads with over-the-counter 
hydrocortisone (anti-itch) cream</li>
</ul>
Jock itch typically affects the groin and inner thighs. It may spread to the 
abdomen and buttocks, but the scrotum usually isn’t affected.

     <h2>How is jock itch diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Your doctor will likely be able to diagnose jock itch simply by performing a physical 
exam and inspecting the affected area of skin. In some cases, your doctor may 
take some scrapings of skin cells from the area to help diagnose the condition. 
This may also help rule out other skin disorders, such as psoriasis.

     <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Check your feet and treat athlete's foot if it is present, as it can often 
spread from there.
<br><br>
Over-the-counter antifungal creams such as <b>miconazole (eg, Monistat®), clotrimazole 
(Lotrimin®), or tolnaftate (Tinactin®)</b> are very effective. Apply it twice a day 
until a few days after the rash seems to be gone, which usually takes about 2–3 weeks. 
You may still see flat, brown areas of discoloration for several weeks, but these do 
not need to be treated as long as there is no longer itching or bumps and scales
 in the area.
<br><br>
Reinfection can be prevented. Keep the area cool and dry by drying the body thoroughly 
after bathing and wearing loose cotton clothing. Wash your clothing and linens in 
hot water. If you think you also have athlete's foot, use a separate towel for your 
feet and try to keep your feet dry as well, by avoiding wearing shoes for long periods 
or wearing loose-fitting shoes. Clean your bath/shower with bleach and floors with an 
appropriate cleaner to kill any fungal spores. You should also avoid sharing clothing
 and wear footwear in public bathrooms/showers and gyms. Skin folds can be a continually 
 moist environment that aids growth of this fungus. If this is a recurrent problem for you, 
 it may help to lose weight.

     <h2>Treatment of jock itch</h2>

<ul>
<li>Apply an over-the-counter antifungal cream, powder, or spray to the affected area.</li>
<li>Wash the affected area thoroughly with soap and warm water.</li>
<li>Dry the affected area thoroughly after bathing and exercise.</li>

     <h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
If your symptoms don’t improve after two weeks of home treatments, you should make an 
appointment to see your doctor. You may have developed a secondary infection 
that needs prompt treatment.
<br><br>
If you do have jock itch, but it’s not responding to over-the-counter medications 
and home remedies, your doctor may prescribe something stronger. Possible 
medications include:
<ul>
<li><b>econazole, </b>which is a topical medication</li>
<li><b>oxiconazole </b>(Oxistat), which is a topical medication</li>
<li><b>itraconazole</b>(Sporanox), which is an oral medication</li>
<li><b>fluconazole</b>(Diflucan), which is an oral medication</li>
</ul>
Oral antifungal medications may cause unpleasant side effects, such as upset stomach and 
headaches. If you experience any of these side effects, make sure to discuss them with your doctor.

     <h2>How can jock itch be prevented?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<b>Practicing good hygiene</b> is the best defense against jock itch. Regular hand-washing 
can greatly reduce your risk of getting this infection from someone else. It’s also 
important to keep your skin clean and dry, especially the area around your groin. 
Wash the area regularly with soap and dry the area thoroughly after bathing. 
Applying baby powder around your groin can also be helpful for preventing excess moisture.
<br><br>
<b>Avoiding tight-fitting clothing</b> further reduces your risk of jock itch. Tight clothes 
can rub or chafe your skin, which makes you more susceptible to jock itch. You may 
want to try wearing boxer shorts instead of boxer briefs. It’s also beneficial to 
wear loose-fitting clothing in hot or humid weather. Loose clothing can prevent sweating 
and the warm, moist environment in which fungus thrives. Make sure you wash any workout 
clothes or athletic supporters after each use.
<br><br>
<b>Athlete’s foot </b>is another infection that can be caused by the same fungi that cause jock itch. 
If you have athlete’s foot, treat it quickly. You can avoid spreading it to your groin area 
by making sure you don’t use the same towel you use on your feet for your groin.
