        <h2>What is Tinea Corporis?</h2>


<p>
Ringworm of the body is a skin infection caused by a fungus.
<br><br>
“Ringworm” is a misnomer — the infection has nothing to do with worms. Its name comes 
from the small, ring- or circle-shaped rash that appears on the body due to infection. 
In ringworm of the body, the rashes appear on skin regions except for the scalp, groin, 
palms of the hand, and soles of the feet.
<br><br>
The condition is common and highly contagious, but it’s not serious. It’s also sometimes 
referred to as “tinea corporis” after the type of fungus that causes the infection.
<br><br>

There are several kinds of ringworm, including:
<ul>
<li><b>Majocchi's granuloma,</b>a deeper fungal infection of skin, hair, and hair follicles. 
It is most common in women who shave their legs.</li>
<li><b>Tinea corporis gladiatorum,</b> a special name given to tinea corporis spread by 
skin-to-skin contact between wrestlers.</li>
<li><b>Tinea imbricata,</b> a form of tinea corporis seen in Central and South America,
 Asia, and the South Pacific.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>What causes ringworm of the body?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
A group of fungi called dermatophytes cause ringworm. Dermatophytes live off a 
substance called keratin, a tissue found in many parts of a person’s body, including the nails,
 skin, and hair. In ringworm of the body, the fungus infects the skin.
<br><br>
Ringworm of the body is also called tinea corporis after the specific dermatophyte, tinea. 
Other related ringworm fungal infections have similar names, including:
<ul>
<li>tinea pedis, commonly called athlete’s foot</li>
<li>tinea cruris, also known as jock itch</li>
<li>tinea capitis, also known as ringworm of the scalp</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Symptoms of ringworm of the body</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Symptoms of ringworm of the body usually start about 4 to 10 days after contact with the fungus.
<br><br>
Ringworm of the body looks like ring- or circular-shaped rashes with edges that are slightly raised.
 The skin in the middle of these ring-shaped rashes appears healthy. Usually, the rashes are itchy.
 They will spread over the course of the infection
<br><br>
Symptoms of a more severe infection include rings that multiply and merge together. You may also 
develop blisters and pus-filled sores near the rings.

    <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Ringworm may occur in people of all ages, of all races, and of both sexes.
<br><br>
People who are more likely to develop ringworm include:
<ul>
<li>Children</li>
<li>Women of child-bearing age who come into contact with infected children</li>
<li>People who have another tinea infection elsewhere on their bodies: tinea capitis (scalp), 
tinea faciei (face), tinea barbae (beard area), tinea cruris (groin), tinea pedis (feet), or 
tinea unguium (fingernails or toenails)</li>
<li>Athletes, especially those involved in contact sports</li>
<li>People in frequent contact with animals, especially cats, dogs, horses, and cattle</li>
<li>People with weakened immune systems</li>
<li>People who sweat heavily</li>
<li>People who live in warmer, more humid climates</li>
</ul>

    <h2>How is ringworm of the body spread?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
A ringworm infection can be spread in many direct and indirect ways, including:
<ul>
<li><b>Person to person:</b> This happens through direct contact with the skin of a person 
infected with ringworm.</li>
<li><b>Pet/animal to person:</b> This occurs when you have direct contact with an infected pet. 
Both dogs and cats can spread the infection to people. Ferrets, horses, rabbits, goats, and pigs 
can also spread ringworm to people.</li>
<li><b>Inanimate item to person:</b> It’s possible to get ringworm through indirect contact 
with objects, including hair of an infected person, bedding, clothing, shower stalls, and floors.</li>
<li><b>Soil to person:</b> Rarely, a ringworm infection can be spread through contact with highly 
infected soil for an extended amount of time.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>How is ringworm diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
If your doctor suspects that you may have ringworm, they’ll examine your skin and may do 
some tests to rule out other skin conditions not caused by fungus, like atopic dermatitis 
or psoriasis. Usually a skin examination will result in a diagnosis.
<br><br>
Your doctor may also observe skin scrapings from the affected area under a microscope to look 
for fungus. A sample may be sent to a laboratory for confirmation. The laboratory may perform 
a culture test to see if the fungus grows.

    <h2>How is ringworm diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Over-the-counter (OTC) topical fungicidal medications are usually enough to treat the infection. 
The medication may be in the form of a powder, ointment, or cream. It’s applied directly to
 the affected areas of the skin. 
 <br><br>
 These medications include OTC products like:
<ul>
<li><b>clotrimazole</b> (Lotrimin AF)</li>
<li><b>miconazole</b> (Micatin)</li>
<li><b>terbinafine</b> (Lamisil)</li>
<li><b>tolfaftate</b> (Tinactin)</li>
</ul>
Your pharmacist can help you choose which one is right for you.
 <br><br>
If the ringworm of the body is widespread, severe, or does not respond to the above medications, 
your doctor may prescribe a stronger topical medication or a fungicidal that you take by mouth.
<b> Griseofulvin</b> is a commonly prescribed oral treatment for fungal infections.

    <h2>Potential complications</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The infection is not serious and will rarely, if ever, spread below the surface of the skin. 
However, people with a weakened immune system, such as people with HIV or AIDS, may have trouble 
getting rid of the infection.
 <br><br>
As with other types of skin infections and conditions, itchy, irritated, or broken skin can lead 
to secondary bacterial infections that may need treatment with antibiotics.

    <h2>How can ringworm infections be prevented?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Ringworm of the body can be prevented by avoiding contact with someone who has the infection. 
This includes both indirect and direct contact with that person.
 <br><br>
Take the following precautions:
<ul>
<li>Avoid sharing towels, hats, hairbrushes, and clothing with someone who has the infection.</li>
<li>Take your pet to see a vet if you suspect a ringworm infection.</li>
<li>If you have ringworm of the body, be sure to maintain good personal hygiene around other people 
and avoid scratching the affected areas of your skin.</li>
<li>After a shower, dry your skin well — especially between the toes and where skin touches skin, 
such as in the groin and armpits.</li>
</ul>
