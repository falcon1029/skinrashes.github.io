        <h2>What is Dandruff?</h2>


<p>
Dandruff is a common skin condition that causes white or grey flakes of skin to 
appear on the scalp and in the hair.<br>
The flakes are often noticeable if they fall from your scalp on to your shoulders.
Your scalp may also feel dry and itchy.
Dandruff isn't contagious or harmful, but it can be unpleasant and difficult 
to get rid of.

      <h2>What causes dandruff?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<p>
Your skin constantly produces new skin cells and sheds old cells to stay healthy. 
Dandruff can occur when this cycle of skin renewal speeds up.
This leads to patches of dead skin forming on the scalp that come away into the hair.<br><br>
A flaky scalp can be the result of:</p>

<h3>1.Seborrheic dermatitis</h3>
<p>
a common skin condition associated with an overgrowth of yeast on the skin, which can 
cause the scalp, face and other areas of the body to become scaly, itchy and red; 
in babies it's called cradle cap<br><br>

People with seborrheic dermatitis have irritated, oily skin, and they are more 
likely to have dandruff.<br>
Seborrheic dermatitis affects many areas of the skin, including the backs of the ears, 
the breastbone, eyebrows, and the sides of the nose.<br>
The skin will be red, greasy, and covered with flaky white or yellow scales.
Seborrheic dermatitis is closely linked with Malassezia, a fungus that 
normally lives on the scalp and feeds on the oils that the hair follicles secrete.
It does not usually cause a problem, but in some people it becomes overactive, 
causing the scalp to become irritated and to produce extra skin cells.<br>
As these extra skin cells die and fall off, they mix with the oil from the 
hair and scalp, forming dandruff.
</p>

<h3>2.Not enough hair brushing</h3>
<p>
Combing or brushing the hair regularly reduces the risk of dandruff, because 
it aids in the normal shedding of skin.
</p>

<h3>3.tinea capitis</h3>
<p>
a fungal infection of the scalp, also called scalp ringworm
</p>

<h3>4.eczema </h3>
<p>
a common skin condition that causes the skin to become dry, red, flaky and very itchy
</p>
<h3>5.allergic contact dermatitis</h3>
<p>
a reaction to products used on the scalp, such as hair dye, hairspray, hair gel or mousse
</p>
<h3>6.psoriasis </h3>
<p>
a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales
</p>
<h3>7.Yeast</h3>
<p>
People who are sensitive to yeast have a slightly higher chance of dandruff, 
so yeast may play a part. Dandruff is often worse during the winter months 
and better when the weather is warmer.
This may be because ultraviolet-A (UVA) light from the sun counteracts the yeast.
</p>

<h3>8.Dry skin</h3>
<p>
People with dry skin are more likely to have dandruff. Cold winter air combined 
with overheated rooms is a common cause of itchy, flaking skin. Dandruff that 
stems from dry skin tends to have smaller, non-oily flakes.
</p>
<h3>9.Shampooing and skin care products</h3>
<p>
Certain hair care products can trigger a red, itchy, scaling scalp. Frequent 
shampooing may cause dandruff, as it can irritate the scalp.
Some people say not shampooing enough can cause a buildup of oil and dead 
skin cells, leading to dandruff, but evidence is lacking that this is true.
</p>
<h3>10.Medical conditions</h3>
<p>
Adults with Parkinson's disease and some other neurological illnesses are more 
prone to dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis.<br><br>

One study found that between 30 and 83 percent of people with HIV have 
seborrheic dermatitis, compared with 3 to 5 percent in the general population.
Patients who are recovering from a heart attack or a stroke and those with a 
weak immune system may be more prone to dandruff.
</p>
<h3>11.Diet</h3>
<p>
Not consuming enough foods that contain zinc, B vitamins, and some types 
of fats may increase the risk.
</p>
<h3>12.Mental stress</h3>
<p>
There may be a link between stress and many skin problems.
</p>
<h3>13.Age</h3>
<p>
Dandruff is more likely from adolescence through middle age, although it 
can be lifelong. It affects men more than women, possibly for reasons 
related to hormones.

      <h2>Dandruff in babies</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Babies can sometimes have dandruff and yellow, greasy, scaly patches on their scalp. 
This is known as cradle cap.<br>
<img src="images/dandruffbaby.png" alt="nothing" >
Cradle cap appears most often in babies in the first two months.
It tends to last only a few weeks or months.
Gently washing your baby's hair and scalp with baby shampoo can help prevent a 
build-up of scales. Massaging baby oil or natural oil, such as olive oil, 
into their scalp at night can help loosen the crust.

</div>
</div>


<div class="card">
    <div class="header">
      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
 Treatment aims to stop the dandruff by slowing down the reproduction of skin 
 cells or counteracting the yeast production that might be the cause.
The strategy will depend the patient's age and the severity of the condition.


<h3>Shampoos and scalp preparations</h3>
<p>
Shampoos and scalp products are available over the counter at most stores 
and pharmacies. These can control seborrheic dermatitis, but they cannot cure it.
<br><br>
Before using an anti-fungal shampoo, individuals should carefully try to
 remove any scaly or crusty patches on the scalp, as far as possible,
 This will make the shampoo more effective.
<br><br>
Dandruff shampoo is available to treat dandruff in the beard.
</p>

<h3>Ingredients to look out for</h3>
<p>

Most anti-dandruff or anti-fungal shampoos contain at least one of the following 
active ingredients:
<ul>
<li><b>Ketoconazole:</b>An effective anti-fungal. Shampoos containing this 
ingredient can be used at any age.</li>
<li><b>Selenium sulfide: </b>This reduces the production of natural oils by glands 
in the scalp. It is effective at treating dandruff.</li>
<li><b>Zinc pyrithione:</b>This slows down the growth of yeast.</li>
<li><b>Coal tar:</b>This has a natural anti-fungal agent. Dyed or treated hair
 may become stained by long-term usage. Tar soaps may also make the scalp more 
 sensitive to sunlight, so users should wear a hat when outside.
 Coal tar can also be carcinogenic in high doses.</li>
<li><b>Salicylic acids:</b>These help the scalp get rid of skin cells. They do 
not slow down the reproduction of skin cells. Many "scalp scrubs" contain 
salicylic acids. Treatment can sometimes leave the scalp dry and make skin 
flaking worse.</li>
<li><b>Tea-tree oil:</b>Derived from the Australian Tea Tree (Melaleuca alternifolia), 
many shampoos now include this ingredient. It has long been used as an anti-fungal, 
an antibiotic, and an antiseptic. Some people are allergic to it.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
Make sure you read the instructions that come with the shampoo before using 
it to check if it's suitable for you and see how often it should be applied.
 A pharmacist can offer advice if you need it.<br><br>
 
It's particularly important to leave the shampoo in your hair for at least 
five minutes before washing it out.<br><br>

Try these shampoos for a month to see if your dandruff improves. You might 
need to try more than one type to find one that works for you.<br><br>

You may be able to use the shampoo less often once your symptoms improve, 
but your dandruff will probably come back if you stop using it completely.<br><br>

The best strategy is to select a shampoo containing one of these ingredients 
and shampoo the hair every day until the dandruff is under control.
<br><br>
Alternating dandruff shampoo with regular shampoo may help. A specific 
shampoo may stop being as effective after some time. At this point, it 
may be a good idea to switch to one with another ingredient.<br><br>

Some shampoos should be left on the scalp for around 5 minutes, as rinsing 
too quickly will not give the ingredient time to work. Others should be 
rinsed at once. Users should follow the instructions on the container.
