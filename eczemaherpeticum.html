<h2>What is eczema herpeticum?</h2>
<p>
Eczema herpeticum is a rare, painful skin rash usually caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV1 is the virus 
that causes cold sores, and it can spread through skin-to-skin contact.
<br><br>
EH most commonly affects infants and young children who have eczema or other inflammatory skin conditions. But it 
also can affect adults.
<br><br>
Fast Fact
This condition was initially called Kaposi varicelliform eruption, after the person who first described it and 
thought the eruption resembled that of chicken pox.
<br><br>
EH is treated with antiviral drugs, and it can become severe and life-threatening if not treated quickly. The viral
 infection is contagious. If you have EH, you should be careful of spreading it to other people who have eczema or 
 compromised immune systems.
<br><br>
Although EH is uncommon, its occurrence has reportedly been increasing in recent years. Keep reading to learn how 
to identify it, what causes it, and more.

      <h2>What are the symptoms of EH?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The EH rash usually affects the face and neck area, but can be seen on any area of the body, including skin that’s 
unaffected by eczema.
<br><br>
EH typically starts suddenly with clusters of small, fluid-filled blisters that are painful and itchy. The blisters 
all look alike, and can be red, purplish, or black. The rash can spread to new sites 7 to 10 days after the first 
outbreak.
<br><br>
The blisters ooze pus when they break open. The lesions then crust over. The EH rash heals in two to six weeks. It 
can leave scars.
<br><br>
Other symptoms may include:
<ul>
<li>high fever</li>
<li>chills</li>
<li>swollen lymph glands</li>
<li>general unwell feeling</li>
</ul>

      <h2>What causes EH?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<p>
Eczema herpeticum is caused by <b>Herpes simplex virus HSV1,</b> the virus that causes cold sores; it can also be caused 
by other related viruses.
<br><br>
Eczema herpeticum develops when the virus infects large areas of skin, rather than being confined to a small area 
as in the common cold sore. It develops in the skin of susceptible people, usually those with a pre-existing 
diagnosis of atopic eczema. Sometimes it begins as a cold sore and then spreads to affect the face and other areas 
of the body, but it may occur without a preceding cold sore.
<br><br>
Patients whose eczema began in infancy or those with severe eczema are at higher risk of developing eczema 
herpeticum. It can also be triggered by trauma or cosmetic procedures (lasers, skin peels, dermabrasion).
</p>

<h3>Is it hereditary?</h3>

<p>
No.

      <h2>Who is at risk for EH?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Children with eczema are the most common group to have EH. But only a small percentage of children and others with 
eczema develop EH. People with severe or untreated eczema are more likely to be affected.
<br><br>
Eczema damages the outer layer of your skin, leaving it dry, sensitive, and more vulnerable to infection. Other 
suggested risk factors are the lack of antiviral proteins and a lack of cells that promote antivirus immune 
responses.
<br><br>
A 2003 study found that people with EH had significantly earlier onset of eczema and significantly higher levels 
of the antibodies produced by their immune system to combat allergies.
<br><br>
People who have damaged skin resulting from other skin diseases or burns are also at risk.
<br><br>
Some prescription skin creams, such as tacrolimus (Prograf), that affect the skin’s immune system may also 
increase your risk. Hot tub and bath exposure may also increase your risk.

      <h2>What does eczema herpeticum look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Eczema herpeticum starts with groups of small blisters, occurring in normal skin or in areas affected by eczema 
or other skin conditions where the skin is inflamed. Further blisters can form over a period of 7 to 10 days and
 may spread, sometimes covering large areas of the face and body. The blisters at their outset contain a clear 
 fluid which then develops into pus.They may weep or bleed, and heal in 2 to 4 weeks, rarely resulting in scars.
<br><br>
Eczema herpeticum can affect any part of the skin, but is most common on the face and neck.

      <h2>How will eczema herpeticum be diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
	<p>
Your doctor can likely diagnose EH by its appearance, but they may want to confirm the diagnosis. This is 
because EH can resemble some bacterial infections, such as impetigo. It also can look like a severe flare-up of 
eczema or other skin ailments.
<br><br>
However, your doctor should have you take systemic antiviral drugs immediately if EH is suspected. Due to the 
serious complications of EH, your doctor likely won’t wait for tests to confirm the presence of the virus.
<br><br>
Your doctor can confirm an EH diagnosis by taking a smear of a blister to check for the virus. Several tests are 
available to identify the virus, including culturing the sample, identifying antibodies to the virus, or examining 
it under a light microscope.
<br><br>
It’s also possible to have a secondary bacterial infection, which should be identified for proper treatment.
<br><br>
If left untreated — or not treated soon enough — EH can lead to blindness (though this is rare) and other 
complications. If the lesions are near your eyes, your doctor should refer you to a specialist for evaluation.
 HSV can infect your eyes, damaging the cornea.
<br><br>
A 2012 study recommends that doctors routinely check eczema outpatients for signs of EH, because of its 
potential seriousness. It’s one of the true dermatologic emergencies, and prompt diagnosis and treatment are
 essential.
</p>

<h3>Can it be cured?</h3>
<p>
Yes – with antiviral treatment. However, the infection can reoccur in some people.

    <div class="header">
      <h2>How is it treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Your doctor will prescribe <b>an antiviral drug,</b> such as <b>acyclovir (Zovirax) or valacyclovir (Valtrex),</b> to be 
taken for 10 to 14 days until the EH lesions heal. If you’re too ill to take drugs orally, your doctor may 
prescribe <b>intravenous antivirals.</b> Some severe cases may require hospitalization.
<br><br>
If you also have a bacterial infection with EH, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics.
<br><br>
Antiviral drugs will cure EH, but the disease can recur. Its return is usually milder after the first attack.

      <h2>What can I do?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

<ul>
<li>Inform your doctor, or if your condition is deteriorating quickly, the doctor in the A&E, if you have any 
of the above mentioned symptoms including discomfort of your eyes. You would need to be referred to an 
ophthalmologist if eye involvement is suspected.</li>
<li>The herpes virus is contagious to certain susceptible individuals, so whilst affected with active eczema 
herpeticum it is advisable to avoid contact with newborn babies, young children, immunosuppressed people or 
other individuals with atopic eczema.</li>
<li>People who have experienced eczema herpeticum should avoid close contact with relatives or friends with
 active cold sores.</li>
</ul>

      <h2>What is the outlook with EH?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Getting treatment as soon as possible for EH can reduce your risk of complications. Antiviral drugs should 
clear up your EH in 10 to 14 days. EH can recur, but recurrences aren’t as common. When it does recur, it’s
 usually milder.

      <h2>Can you prevent EH?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
If you have eczema, you can prevent EH by avoiding contact with someone who has a cold sore. You should also 
avoid using anything that has touched the mouth of someone with a cold sore, such as a glass, fork, or lipstick.
