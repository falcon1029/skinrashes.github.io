<h2>What is impetigo?</h2>

<p>
    Impetigo is a bacterial infection of the surface of the skin. In the it is the most common skin infection
    seen in young children.

     <h2>What causes impetigo?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    In the UK, impetigo is usually due to a germ known as Staphylococcus aureus; in hot climates it may
    be due to Streptococcus pyogenes, or to a mixture of the two. These germs pass from person to person,
    and impetigo can spread rapidly through families and school classes - by skin-to-skin contact or, less
    often, by bedding, clothing and towels. However impetigo can also arrive out of the blue, with no hint
    of where it came from.
<br><br>
    The germs that cause impetigo can invade normal skin, but can also take advantage of skin that is
    already damaged by cuts or grazes, insect bites, head lice, scabies, cold sores, or eczema.
<br><br>
    Impetigo is most common in children, and in warm humid weather.


<h3>Is impetigo hereditary?</h3>
<p>
    No, but several members of a family often get it at the same time.
</p>

<h3>What are its symptoms?</h3>
<p>
    Impetigo can be sore and itchy but does not usually make you feel ill.

     <h2>What does impetigo look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Impetigo can crop up anywhere, but is most common on exposed areas of skin such as the face - around the
    nose and mouth - and on the hands. It starts as groups of thin-roofed pus-filled blisters which tend to break
    quickly to leave round oozing patches covered with honey-coloured or brownish crusts. The patches are small at
    first – half an inch or so across - but slowly get bigger. Smaller ‘satellite’ patches can come up nearby and
    may enlarge too. As the patches clear up, their crusts fall off and the areas heal without leaving scars.

     <h2>How will impetigo be diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Your doctor will base the diagnosis on the way the rash looks, and will check to see if it has come up on
    top of another skin condition, such as scabies. A swab from a crusted area may be sent to the laboratory
    to see which germ is causing the impetigo and which antibiotic is most likely to help. However treatment
    should not wait until the results are through. If you are getting recurrent episodes of impetigo your
    doctor may take a swab from your nose to see if the infective bacteria are harbouring there.


<h3>Can impetigo be cured?</h3>
<p>
    Yes. Usually it clears quickly; but it will not do so if it is based on an unrecognised underlying skin
    problem such as scabies or head lice.

     <h2>How can impetigo be treated? </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The first step is to remove the crusts gently and regularly - antibacterial liquid soap/skin
    wash and water is as good for this as anything else. Apply an antibiotic cream, or
    ointment, onto the patches and the skin around them, two or three times a day, for 7-
    10 days until they clear up. Antibiotic creams such as mupirocin or fusidic acid will
    usually be prescribed. Retapamulin is a newer antibiotic cream that is occasionally
    used. However, the bacteria that cause impetigo are becoming less likely to respond
    to these antibiotics than in the past. For this reason, creams containing antiseptics
    such as povidone iodine or chlorhexidine may be recommended as an alternative.
    <br><br>
    Your doctor or nurse will decide whether you need a course of oral antibiotic tablets
    as well as the antibiotic ointment. This approach may be used if your impetigo is wide
    spread or is slow to get better with antibiotic applications alone, or keeps coming back.
    Antibiotics called flucloxacillin, erythromycin and cephalexin can be effective for
    widespread infection and are taken for at least 7 days. Penicillin can be added to the
    treatment if your impetigo is due to a streptococcal infection.

     <h2>What can be done to reduce the spread of impetigo? </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

    <ul>
    <li>Avoid touching patches of impetigo, and stop other people touching them too. </li>
    <li>Hygiene is important - always wash your hands after accidentally touching the
        area (and ask other people to do the same). </li>
    <li>Wash your hands before and after putting the antibiotic cream or ointment on
        the impetigo. </li>
    <li>Don’t share towels, flannels etc. until the infection has cleared. Always use a
        clean cloth each time to dry the affected area.</li>
    <li>To prevent the spread of bacteria, the patient's towels, pillowcases, and sheets
        should be changed and washed on the hottest available setting (at least 60
        degrees) with the addition of laundry bleach. Clothing and bedding should be
        washed and changed daily during the first few days of treatment. Children with
        impetigo should be kept off school or nursery until affected areas have healed
        or 48 hours after starting antibiotic treatment.</li>
    <li>It is fine to continue with your normal bathing and skin care routine. However,
        be careful to avoid contaminating creams by touching the affected skin and then
        putting your finger back into the pot. </li>
