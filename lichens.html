<h2>What is lichen sclerosus?</h2>

<p>
    Lichen sclerosus is a relatively uncommon condition in which thin white crinkly patches appear on the skin.
    It can appear anywhere, but is most troublesome in the genital areas.

     <h2>What causes lichen sclerosus?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The cause of lichen sclerosus is not known. Sometimes it is associated with diseases in which the body’s
    immune system attacks normal tissues such as the thyroid gland (causing an over- or underactive thyroid gland)
    or the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas (causing diabetes).<br><br>

    Lichen sclerosus can occur in either sex and at any site, but is more common in women, in whom the vulva is the
    most common site. Lichen sclerosus can affect women of any age and may occasionally develop in girls prior to
    puberty. A similar process affects men and boys. Despite the tendency to affect genital skin, lichen sclerosus
    is not an infection - it is quite certain that the disease is not contagious, so sexual partners cannot pick it up.

<h3>Is lichen sclerosus hereditary?</h3>
<p>
    Rarely lichen sclerosus can occur in relatives.

     <h2>What are the symptoms of lichen sclerosus?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Many patients have none, but the most common symptom of lichen sclerosus is itch. As a rule the spots on the general
    skin surface seldom itch much, but those in the genital area do, and can also be sore if the skin breaks down or
    cracks. In the genital area, the scar-like process can tighten the skin, and this can interfere with sexual
    intercourse in affected men or women. In men, lichen sclerosus can make the foreskin tight and difficult to
    retract, and can even partly block the flow of urine.

     <h2>What does lichen sclerosus look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    On the main areas of the skin, the spots of lichen sclerosus look like small ivory-coloured slightly raised areas,
    which can join up to form white patches.  Some have tiny yellowish horny plugs within the pale areas. After a while
    the surface of the spots can look like wrinkled tissue paper. The most common sites are the bends of the wrists, the
    upper trunk, around the breasts, the neck and armpits.<br><br>

    Women with lichen sclerosus in other areas of the body often have it on the vulva as well. Sometimes this causes no
    symptoms and they may not even know it is there. The white thin fragile areas surrounding the vulva and the anus in a
    figure of eight pattern have a crinkly surface; their fragility may lead to easy bruising and erosions. Later on, the
    inner lips of the vulva and its opening can shrink, leading to pain on intercourse, but this is unusual in most cases.
    Less often lichen sclerosus can develop in young girls then get better at puberty. A similar process in men affects the
    penis (balanitis xerotica obliterans). It can make retraction of the foreskin difficult and interfere with passing water.

     <h2>How will lichen sclerosus be diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The diagnosis of lichen sclerosus can usually be made from the typical appearance of the condition. However, lichen
    sclerosus can look a bit like vitiligo (though this has a normal skin texture) and lichen planus (which is more purple).
    If there is any doubt, the examination of a small specimen of skin (a biopsy) under the microscope will help.

<h3>Can lichen sclerosus be cured?</h3>
<p>
    No treatment is sure to reverse the changes of lichen sclerosus completely, but the symptoms and signs of the disease
    can usually be well controlled with a steroid application.

     <h2>How can lichen sclerosus be treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    A variety of treatments are available for lichen sclerosus:
    <ul>
    <li>Strong steroid ointments are used to stop the inflammation and also soften the
        affected skin. Please do not worry about the warning inside the pack, where it
        might say ‘not to use these ointments on genital skin’ - your dermatologist will
        advise you how and when to apply the steroid ointments safely. </li>
    <li>Moisturisers help to soften and protect the skin.</li>
    <li>The fragile skin of lichen sclerosus may be more susceptible than normal skin
        to infection with Candida yeasts (thrush) or bacteria, and may split or even
        bleed. Your doctor will treat these problems if they arise. </li>
    <li>Rarely, a small operation may be needed to divide adhesions if the skin sticks
        together. </li>
</ul>

     <h2>Self Care (What can I do?)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

<ul>
    <li>Avoid washing with soap and instead use an emollient soap substitute/ cream.</li>
    <li>Carefully dry yourself after passing urine to reduce the contact of urine with
        your skin. </li>
    <li>Using a moisturiser or yellow soft paraffin as a barrier cream can protect your
        skin from exposure to urine. </li>
    <li>If sexual intercourse is painful because of tightening at the entrance to the
        vagina, the use of lubricants and, on occasions, vaginal dilators, will help. </li>
    <li>Keep an eye on your skin. Cancer of the vulva may be a little more likely to
        occur in lichen sclerosus that has been present for many years than in normal
        skin. Lifelong regular self-examination is very important for all females who
        have or have had genital lichen sclerosus. If any skin change develops which
        does not respond to steroid creams, in particular any skin thickening, soreness
        or ulceration lasting more than two weeks, you need to tell your doctor without
        delay. You may need a biopsy to test for skin cancer. </li>
    <li>If you are a smoker, stop smoking to reduce the risk of cancer. </li>
</ul>
