<h2>What is a keloid?</h2>

<p>
    When a wound heals, it leaves a scar. A keloid is a special type of scar: one that grows too much and can even
    become larger than the original wound. It is not uncommon for surgical or injury scars to become a little lumpy
    (hypertrophic). A keloid differs from these in several ways:
<ul>

    <li>A keloid can come up after very minor skin damage, such as an acne spot, or even if there has been no obvious damage to the skin at all.</li>
    <li>It can spread outside the original area of skin damage.</li>
    <li>It may last for many years.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Are keloids hereditary?</h3>
<p>
    They can be - a tendency to get keloids certainly runs in some families.
</p>

<h3>What are the symptoms of a keloid?</h3>
<p>
    Usually there are none; but some are tender, painful, itchy, or cause a burning sensation. The main problem is
    that their appearance may cause embarrassment. If they are very tight, they can limit movement at nearby joints.

     <h2>What does a keloid look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Keloids look like exaggerated scars. They are raised above the skin around them and sometimes they are domed.
    They can extend beyond the limits of the skin damage that caused the scar to come up in the first place. They are
    shiny and hairless; usually they feel hard and rubbery; and new ones are often red or purple, becoming browner and
    sometimes paler as they age. Most people with keloids have only one or two. However some people have many,
    especially if they have come up after acne or chickenpox scars.

     <h2>How will it be diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Your doctor will be able to make the diagnosis of a keloid just by looking at your skin. No investigations are usually needed.


<h3>Can a keloid be cured?</h3>
<p>
    It is unusual for a keloid to be cured after treatment. The main problem is that cutting a keloid out often leads
    to an even bigger one forming later in the same place.

     <h2>How can a keloid be treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    <ul>
    <li>Injections of a steroid (triamcinolone) into a keloid may help to flatten
        small early ones. </li>
    <li>Steroid-impregnated tape applied for 12 to 24 hours a day may help to
        flatten keloids.</li>
    <li>Freezing with liquid nitrogen may also stop early keloids from growing.</li>
    <li>Putting a silicone sheet over them at night for several months helps
        some keloids to flatten. Silicone in gel form is also available. Long-term
        compression with pressure bandages sometimes helps too. </li>
    <li>Laser treatment makes keloids less red, but does not make them
        smaller. </li>
    <li>If a keloid is cut out, it usually comes back, and may end up larger than
        before. This risk falls if the area is treated after the operation with
        pressure dressings or local steroid injections.
    </li>
    <li>Sometimes, 5-fluorouracil and imiquimod are used to reduce size either
        alone or before using other types of treatment.
    </li>
</ul>
