<h2>What is a fungal infection of the nail?</h2>

<p>
    Fungal infections of the nails are also known as onychomycosis, as tinea unguium, and as ringworm of the nails.
    The fungi in question are usually those that cause athlete’s foot – a common infection of the skin of the feet.
    In athlete’s foot the fungi live in the keratin that makes up the outer layer of the skin, but they can also
    invade the hard keratin of which nails are made. When this happens, the result is a fungal infection of a nail.

    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Fungi spreading from athlete’s foot (known as ‘dermatophyte fungi’) cause most fungal nail infections.
    Far less often a nail infection is due to other types of fungi, usually yeasts (eg. Candida) and moulds
    (eg. Scopulariopsis), which do not cause athlete’s foot. These like to attack nails that are already weak,
    perhaps after an old injury. Fungal infections of toenails are common, those of fingernails far less so.
    Both are seen most often in the elderly.


<h3>Are they hereditary?</h3>
<p>
    No, but several family members may have them at the same time because they can catch them from each other.

     <h2>What are the symptoms of fungal infections of the nails?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    At the start, there are usually no symptoms. Later the nails may become so thick that they hurt when they
    press on the inside of a shoe. They are then hard to trim. The look of an infected nail, particularly a
    fingernail, can be embarrassing.

     <h2>What do fungal infections of the nails look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    When fungi invade a nail, they usually start at its free edge, and then spread down the side of the nail towards
    its base. Eventually the whole nail may be involved. The infected areas turn white or yellowish, and become
    thickened and crumbly. Less common patterns of infection include white patches or streaks on the nail surface.
    The nails most commonly affected by fungal infections are those on the big and little toes. When several
    fingernails are infected, they are usually on the same hand.

    <div class="container">
    Many nail problems can look like a fungal infection - for example the changes seen in psoriasis, or after a
    bacterial infection or an old injury – but long courses of antifungal tablets will not help them. This is
    why the diagnosis of a fungal infection must always be confirmed before treatment starts. Your doctor will
    take a piece from a crumbly area of your nail and send it to the laboratory to check if a fungus can be
    seen under the microscope or grown in culture. The right treatment may depend on knowing which fungus
    is causing the trouble but it can take several weeks for the final culture results to come through.


<h3>Can fungal infections of the nails be cured?</h3>
<p>
    Yes - usually they can.

     <h2>How can fungal infections of the nails be treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Fungal infections of the nail do not clear up by themselves, but not all of them
    need treatment. Some people with infected toenails are not bothered by them
    at all. In that case, they can sometimes be left alone (although the patient
    should remain cautious and try not to spread the infection to other parts of the
    body and nails or other people). On the other hand, if infected nails are
    embarrassing or uncomfortable then they are usually treated. It is important to
    treat people whose infections may cause significant health problems such as
    those with diabetes or immune suppression, in order to prevent potentially
    serious health problems.<br><br>
    The aim of the treatment is to get rid of the fungus: the nail will then usually
    return to normal. However, if the nail was abnormal before it was infected, it
    will be harder to clear and may just go back to its former state. Nail infections
    caused by moulds and yeasts can be very resistant to treatment.
    <br><br>
    Treatment options include:


</p>

<h3>1.Treatments applied to the nail (topical treatments)</h3>
<p>

<ul>
    <li>Treatments applied to the nail work less well than those taken by
        mouth. They are most effective if the infection is treated at an early
        stage. The treatments used most often are amorolfine nail lacquer,
        ciclopirox and tioconazole nail solution. Alone, they may not be able to
        clear the deeper parts of an infected nail, though regular removal of
        abnormal nail material with clippers or filing can help with this. Used in
        combination with an antifungal remedy taken by mouth, they increase
        the chance of a cure. They may have to be used for a period of 4 to 12
        months before a response is noted. The course of treatment is shorter
        for fingernail infections. The cure rate with topical agents alone, is low,
        approximately 15-30%. Topical treatments are safe. Local redness and
        irritation can occur.</li>

</ul>
</p>
<h3>2.Treatment by mouth (oral treatments)</h3>
<p>
    Before starting on tablets, the doctor should send a piece of the nail to the
    laboratory to check that the diagnosis of a fungal infection is confirmed.
    </p><p>
    Three medicines are available for use in fungal nail infections
<ul>
    <li><b>Griseofulvin</b>has been used for many years and is the only one of the
        three medicines licensed for use in children. It is only absorbed fully if
        taken with fatty foods (e.g. dairy products and milk), and long courses
        of treatment are usually needed (6 to 9 months for fingernails, and up
        to 18 months for toenails). Even so, only about three quarters of
        infected fingernails and one third of infected toenails will clear up.
        Relapses are common.
    </li>
    <li><b>Terbinafine and itraconazole</b>have largely taken over from
        griseofulvin now. They work better and much more quickly, although
        only about 50% of nail infections are cured. Terbinafine should be
        considered as first line treatment for dermatophyte fungi (the ones that
        cause athlete’s foot). It is taken daily for 6 weeks for fingernail
        infections and for 12-16 weeks for toenail infections.</li>
    <li><b>Itraconazole </b>e is effective in treating dermatophytes too; it is also useful
        for treating other fungi such as yeasts. It is often given in bursts – for
        one week in every month – because it is deposited into the cuticle of
        the nail and continues to be effective for a few weeks. Two of these
        weekly courses, taken 21 days apart, are usually enough for fingernail
        infections and three for toenail infections.
    </li>
    <li><b>Fluconazole</b>can be effective for Candida fungal infections. It is
        currently not licensed for fungal nail infections. It appears to be less
        effective than itraconazole and terbinafine but remains an alternative if
        someone is not able to tolerate these two medications. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>3.Other treatments</h3>
<p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Laser treatments, photodynamic therapy </b>may be helpful but are less
        effective than the topical and systemic treatments listed above. These
        treatment options are not currently available on the NHS.</li>
    <li><b>Herbal products </b>are promoted for fungal nail infection, but there is no
        good evidence that they are safe or more effective than standard
        treatments.
    </li>
    </ul>

     <h2>How will I know if the treatment is working? </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The new nail will grow slowly outwards from its base, and it may be 6 months
    to a year after the treatment has finished before the nails look normal again.
    Fingernail infections clear up more quickly and completely than toenail ones; it
    can take 18 months for a toenail infection to grow out completely.
