        <h2>What is a Dry Skin (Xerosis Cutis?</h2>


<p>
Dry skin (xerosis) is a condition of rough, dry skin with fine scaling of skin 
and, occasionally, with small cracks in the skin. Dry skin is also known as winter
 itch or asteatosis.
<br><br>
Often itchy, dry skin is caused by environmental factors, such as cold weather and 
frequent bathing, and by medical conditions, such as atopic dermatitis and malnutrition.
 Dry skin develops due to a decrease in the natural oils in the outer layer of skin, 
 which makes the skin lose water.

      <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<b>Healthy bathing habits can improve dry skin:</b>
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Take a bath or shower only once daily. More frequent bathing can make the skin lose water (dehydrate).</li>
<li>Use lukewarm (not hot) water.</li>
<li>Limit bath time to 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Avoid harsh deodorant soaps (or limit their use to armpits, groin, and feet).</li>
<li>Use non-soap cleansers.</li>
<li>Pat (don't rub) the skin dry after bathing.</li>
<li>Apply moisturizer immediately after bathing, while the skin is still moist.</li>
<li>When choosing a moisturizer, look for oil-based creams and ointments, which 
work better than water-based lotions.</li>
</ul>

<b>The following over-the-counter products may be helpful:</b>

<ul>
<li>Petrolatum or petroleum jelly (Vaseline®)</li>
<li>Fragrance-free creams or ointments</li>
<li>Preparations containing alpha-hydroxy acids such as glycolic acid or lactic acid</li>
<li>Creams containing urea</li>
<li>Over-the-counter cortisone cream (if the areas are itchy)</li>
<li>Topical antibiotics applied immediately to any cracks in the skin to help prevent infection</li>
</ul>
Use a humidifier in the bedroom during the cold, dry seasons to help prevent dry skin.

      <h2>When should I see a doctor?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
You should see a dermatologist if:

<ul>
<li>your skin is oozing</li>
<li>large areas of your skin are peeling</li>
<li>you have a ring-shaped rash</li>
<li>your skin doesn’t improve within a few weeks</li>
<li>your skin gets much worse, despite treatment</li>
</ul>

You may have a fungal or bacterial infection, an allergy, or another skin condition.
 Excessive scratching of dry skin can also lead to an infection.
<br><br>
Dry skin in younger people may be caused by a condition called atopic dermatitis, 
commonly known as eczema. Eczema is characterized by extremely dry, itchy skin.
 Blisters and hard, scaly skin are common in people with this condition. A dermatologist
 can help determine whether you or your child has eczema. If you are diagnosed with 
 eczema, your treatment plan will be different from a person with xerosis cutis.

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The physician may prescribe:
<ul>
<li>Cream containing alpha- or beta-hydroxy acids (glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid)</li>
<li>Urea-based cream</li>
<li>Preparation containing high concentrations of propylene glycol</li>
<li>Corticosteroid (cortisone) cream, if the skin is inflamed or very itchy</li>
</ul>
If the physician suspects that a medical condition is causing your dry skin, 
then he or she may do blood tests or other diagnostic procedures. The best treatment 
for dry skin caused by a medical problem is to treat the medical problem.
