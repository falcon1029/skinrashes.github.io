      <h1>Bacterial Nail Infection(Paronychia)</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>What is Paronychia?</h2>
Paronychia is an infection of the skin around your fingernails and toenails.
Bacteria or a type of yeast called Candida typically cause this infection. 
Bacteria and yeast can even combine in one infection.
<br><br>
Depending on the cause of the infection, paronychia may come on slowly and 
last for weeks or show up suddenly and last for only one or two days. The 
symptoms of paronychia are easy to spot and can usually be easily and successfully 
treated with little or no damage to your skin and nails. Your infection can become 
severe and even result in a partial or complete loss of your nail if it’s not treated.

      <h2>Acute and chronic paronychia</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Paronychia can be either acute or chronic depending on the speed of onset, the
 duration, and the infecting agents.



<h3>Acute paronychia</h3>

<p>
An acute infection almost always occurs around the fingernails and develops quickly. 
It’s usually the result of damage to the skin around the nails from biting, picking, 
hangnails, manicures, or other physical trauma. Staphylococcus and Enterococcus bacteria
 are common infecting agents in the case of acute paronychia.
</p>
<h3>Chronic paronychia</h3>

<p>
Chronic paronychia can occur on your fingers or toes, and it comes on slowly. It lasts 
for several weeks and often comes back. It’s typically caused by more than one infecting
 agent, often Candida yeast and bacteria. It’s more common in people who’re constantly 
 working in water. Chronically wet skin and excessive soaking disrupts the natural barrier
 of the cuticle. This allows yeast and bacteria to grow and get underneath the skin to 
 create an infection.

      <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Acute paronychia may occur at any age but is particularly common in children. 
Viral paronychia occurs more often in adults and may be seen with genital herpes 
infection or in people who work in the health care industry.
<br><br>
Chronic paronychia is most common in adult women and those who work in places where 
their hands are kept moist, such as food handlers.

      <h2>Symptoms of paronychia</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

The symptoms of both acute and chronic paronychia are very similar. They’re largely 
distinguished from each other by the speed of onset and the duration of the infection. 
Chronic infections come on slowly and last for many weeks. Acute infections develop 
quickly and don’t last long. Both infections can have the following symptoms:
<ul>
<li>redness of the skin around your nail</li>
<li>tenderness of the skin around your nail</li>
<li>pus-filled blisters</li>
<li>changes in nail shape, color, or texture</li>
<li>detachment of your nail</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Causes of paronychia</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
There are multiple causes of both acute and chronic paronychia. The underlying cause 
of each is bacteria, Candida yeast, or a combination of the two agents.



<h3>Acute paronychia</h3>

<p>
A bacterial agent that’s introduced to the area around your nail by some type of 
trauma typically causes an acute infection. This can be from biting or picking at 
your nails or hangnails, being punctured by manicurist tools, pushing down your
 cuticles too aggressively, and other similar types of injuries.
</p>


<h3>Chronic paronychia</h3>

<p>
The underlying agent of infection in chronic paronychia is most commonly Candida yeast, 
but it can also be bacteria. Because yeasts grow well in moist environments, this 
infection is often caused by having your feet or hands in water too much of the time. 
Chronic inflammation also plays a role.

      <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<ul>
<li>Try soaking the nails in warm water for acute paronychia.</li>
<li>Avoid water and chemical exposure to prevent symptoms of chronic paronychia.</li>
</ul>

      <h2>How paronychia is diagnosed</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
In most cases, a doctor can diagnose paronychia simply by observing it.
<br><br>
Your doctor may send a sample of pus from your infection to a lab if treatment doesn’t 
seem to be helping. This will determine the exact infecting agent and will allow your 
doctor to prescribe the best treatment.

      <h2>How paronychia is treated</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
For acute paronychia, your doctor may:
<ul>
<li>Puncture and drain the affected area and test for bacteria or viral infection.</li>
<li>Prescribe antibiotics for a bacterial infection or an antiviral medication for a 
herpes infection.</li>
</ul>
For chronic paronychia, your doctor may:

<ul>
<li>Prescribe a topical steroid.</li>
<li>Prescribe a topical antifungal medication.</li>
<li>Prescribe an oral antifungal medicine or antibiotics.</li>
</ul>

      <h2>How paronychia can be prevented</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Good hygiene is important for preventing paronychia. Keep your hands and feet clean 
to prevent bacteria from getting between your nails and skin. Avoiding trauma caused 
by biting, picking, manicures, or pedicures can also help you prevent acute infections.
<br><br>
To prevent a chronic infection, you should avoid excessive exposure to water and wet 
environments and keep your hands and feet as dry as possible.

      <h2>Long-term outlook</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The outlook is good if you have a mild case of acute paronychia. You can treat it successfully, 
and it’s unlikely to return. If you let it go untreated for too long, the outlook is still 
good if you get medical treatment.
<br><br>
Chronic infection is likely to last for weeks or months. This can often be more difficult
 to manage. So early treatment is important.
