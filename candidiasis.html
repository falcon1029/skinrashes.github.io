      <h1>Yeast Infection (Candidiasis)</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>What is Candidiasis?</h2>
Candidiasis, commonly known as a yeast infection, is an infection with the common 
yeast (or fungus) organism, Candida albicans, which is commonly found in the environment.
 Sometimes this yeast lives in the mouth, digestive (gastrointestinal) tract, and the 
 vagina, along with many kinds of harmless bacteria, without causing any issues. However, 
 under certain conditions (particularly weakening of the immune system, the use of 
 antibiotics, exposure to cancer drugs or corticosteroids, or in diabetics), the 
 fungus will multiply and cause disease.
<br><br>
There are different forms of yeast infection, depending upon the area affected. 
Most commonly, the mouth, vagina, and damper skin areas are affected, 
as the yeast likes to grow in moist areas.
<br><br>
Most yeast infections are on the surface (superficial) and easily treated; 
however, serious life-threatening yeast infection can develop throughout 
the body (systemic) in people with very weak immune systems.

      <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Various species of Candida yeast grow in over half of healthy adults.

<ul>
<li>Men and women are affected equally.</li>
<li>People with weakened (suppressed) immune systems, who use antibiotics, 
take cancer drugs or corticosteroids, or are diabetic are more likely to
 develop a yeast infection.</li>
<li>Older people are more likely to get thrush (oral candidiasis).</li>
<li>In women, yeast infection is the second most common cause of inflammation 
of the vagina (vaginitis).</li>
<li>Long-lasting (persistent) symptoms and yeast infection that does not heal 
may be the first sign of infection with HIV.</li>

      <h2>Symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Vaginal yeast infections have a common set of symptoms, such as:

<ul>
<li><b>vaginal itching</b></li>
<li><b>swelling around the vagina</b></li>
<li>burning during <b>urination</b> or sex</li>
<li><b>pain during sex</b></li>
<li><b>soreness</b></li>
<li><b>redness</b></li>
<li><b>rash</b></li>

</ul>
Whitish gray and clumpy vaginal discharge is another telltale symptom.
 Some people say this discharge looks like cottage cheese. Sometimes the 
 discharge may also be watery.
<br><br>
Usually the length of time your yeast infection is left untreated has a direct 
impact on how severe your symptoms may become.

      <h2>What causes vaginal yeast infections?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The fungus Candida is a naturally occurring microorganism in the vaginal area. 
Lactobacillus bacteria keeps its growth in check. But if there’s an imbalance 
in your system, these bacteria won’t work effectively. This leads to an overgrowth 
of yeast, which causes the symptoms of vaginal yeast infections.
<br><br>
Several factors can cause a yeast infection, including:

<ul>
<li><b>antibiotics </b>(they lower the amount of Lactobacillus, or good bacteria, in the vagina)</li>
<li><b>pregnancy</b></li>
<li>uncontrolled <b>diabetes</b></li>
<li><b>weak immune system</b></li>
<li><b>poor eating habits, </b>including a lot of sugary foods</li>
<li><b>hormonal imbalance</b> near your menstrual cycle</li>
<li><b>stress</b></li>
<li><b>lack of sleep</b></li>
</ul>
A specific kind of yeast called Candida albicans causes most yeast infections.
 These yeast infections are easily treatable. If you’re having recurring yeast infections 
 or problems getting rid of a yeast infection with conventional treatment, then a different 
 version of Candida might be the cause. A lab test can identify which type of Candida you have.

      <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The appearance and symptoms of yeast infection depend upon the area affected.
<br><br>
The most common types of infection are:
<ul>
<li>Thrush (oral yeast infection) – The mouth lining, tongue, and/or angles of 
the mouth are red, cracked, or have white patches. There may be soreness or no 
symptoms. This is discussed separately.</li>
<li>Skin (cutaneous) – Small-to-large patches of red, moist, raw skin usually 
develop in body creases, such as under the breasts, belly, or groin area. 
The skin may itch or be painful. Tiny pus-containing lesions (pustules) 
may appear around the edges of the red areas.</li>
<li>Vaginitis – Vaginal itch, pain, or burning are frequent and may be accompanied 
by a cottage-cheese-like discharge. There is usually pain with sexual intercourse.</li>
<li>Esophagitis – Swallowing may be painful, and there may be pain behind the breastbone.</li>
</ul>
</div>

      <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<ul>
<li>Most yeast infections can be prevented by keeping body-fold areas clean and dry.</li>
<li>Diabetics should keep their blood sugar under good control.</li>
<li>Treat skin infection with a combination of an over-the-counter antifungal cream 
(such as clotrimazole or miconazole twice daily for 10–14 days) with hydrocortisone 
cream (0.5–1% applied twice daily after the antifungal cream).</li>
<li>Lose weight if you are overweight.</li>
<li>A NON-pregnant women can treat vaginitis with an over-the-counter vaginal 
suppository or cream antifungals (miconazole or clotrimazole). The woman's partner does 
not normally need treatment. Avoid sexual intercourse until the yeast infection heals.</li>
</ul>

      <h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
See your doctor if your symptoms do not go away with self-care.
<br><br>
Remember that vaginitis can be caused by something other than yeast infection, and 
you might have a sexually transmitted disease if you are sexually active. 
See your doctor to confirm the diagnosis.

      <h2>Vaginal yeast infection Treatment </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Your doctor may prescribe oral antifungal medications for any form of yeast infection that 
does not improve with self-care measures.


<h3>Simple infections</h3>

<p>
For simple yeast infections, your doctor will usually prescribe a 1-3 day regimen 
of an antifungal cream, ointment, tablet, or suppository. These medications can be 
in prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) form.
<br><br>
Common medications include:

<ul>
<li><b>butoconazole</b>( (Gynazole)</li>
<li><b>miconazole</b> (Lotrimin)</li>
<li><b>Monistat</b></li>
<li><b>terconazole</b>(Terazol)</li>
<li><b>fluconazole</b> (Diflucan)</li>
</ul>
Women with simple yeast infections should follow up with their doctors to make sure 
the medicine worked. A follow-up will also be necessary if your symptoms return within 
two months. If you recognize that you have a yeast infection, you can also treat yourself 
at home with OTC products.
</p>

<h3>Complicated infections</h3>

<p>
Your doctor will more than likely treat your yeast infection as if it were a severe or 
complicated case, if you:
<ul>
<li>have severe redness, swelling, and itching that leads to sores or tears in your vaginal tissue</li>
<li>have had more than four yeast infections in a year</li>
<li>have infection caused by Candida other than albicans</li>
<li>are pregnant</li>
<li>have uncontrolled diabetes or a weak immune system from medication</li>
<li>are HIV-positive</li>
</ul>
Possible treatments for severe or complicated yeast infections include:
<ul>
<li>14-day cream, ointment, tablet, or suppository vaginal treatment</li>
<li>two or three doses of fluconazole (Diflucan)</li>
<li>long-term prescription of fluconazole (Diflucan) taken once a week for six weeks, or long-term 
use of a topical antifungal medication</li>
</ul>

If your infection is recurring, you may also want to see if your sexual partner has a yeast infection. 
Remember to use condoms when having sex if you suspect either of you has a yeast infection.
