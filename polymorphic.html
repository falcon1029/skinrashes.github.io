     <h1>Polymorphic Light Eruption</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="container">


<h2>What is PLE?</h2>

<p>
    The term ‘light eruption’ is easy to understand - a rash that comes up after exposure to light. ‘Polymorphic’
    is more difficult. ‘Poly’ means ‘many’, and ‘morphic’ means ‘forms’. In other words, the rash of PLE can take many
    different forms, including small red bumps, larger red areas, and blisters. In PLE, a rash with one or more of these
    components comes up a day or two after exposure to the sun. PLE is common, perhaps affecting up to 10% of the
    population. It tends to appear in the spring.

     <h2>What causes PLE?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    PLE is a response to sunlight. As little as 20 minutes of strong sun can trigger it. PLE can come up even when the
    light has passed through window glass, and sometimes even after exposure to fluorescent lighting. Both long (UVA)
    and short (UVB) wavelengths of ultraviolet light can cause PLE in a susceptible person, but it is still not clear
    how they trigger the rash. An immunological reaction seems the most likely explanation.
<br><br>
    Most people with PLE get it in the spring after they go out in the sun. Often it comes up on a holiday abroad, and
    sometimes it clears up before they return home. The rash tends to affect areas that have been covered by clothing
    during the winter. It goes away without treatment in about a week if there is no further sun exposure. If you stay
    in the sun, the rash will get worse and spread; but as the summer wears on, the skin becomes resistant to sunlight
    and more of it is needed to provoke the rash.

     <h2>Other points about PLE:</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

<ul>

    <li>Women get PLE more often than men.</li>
    <li>It usually starts under the age of 30.</li>
    <li>It affects people with all types of skin but is most common in those who are fair.</li>
    <li>It is most common in countries where the climate is temperate, and exposure to the sun is usually not heavy.</li>
    <li>It is not infectious and has no connection with skin cancer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Is PLE hereditary?</h3>
<p>
    Probably not, although about 15% of those who have PLE know of other family members who have it too.

     <h2>What are the symptoms of PLE?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<ul>
    <li>The rash of PLE can itch or feel like a burn.</li>
    <li>PLE can be embarrassing as it comes up on exposed areas.</li>
    <li>It restricts outdoor activities and holidays in the sun.</li>

     <h2>What does PLE look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<ul>
<li>PLE ranges from a mild rash that lasts for only a short time to a severe and extensive eruption that spoils the quality of life.</li>

<li> The rash comes up equally on both sides of the body, affecting mainly those parts of the skin that are kept covered in the winter –
    such as the arms and the upper trunk. For this reason the face and the backs of the hands are sometimes, but not always, spared.</li>

<li> The appearance of the rash varies from person to person. The most common type has large numbers of small red bumps. In other people
    the rash is made up of larger red areas and small blisters. The rash of each affected person usually looks the same every time it comes back.</li>

<li> When the rash settles, it does so without leaving scars.</li>
</ul>

     <h2>How will PLE be diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Your general practitioner may refer you to a skin specialist who will base the diagnosis of PLE on the appearance of the rash and the
    story that it has been provoked by sunlight. Tests will be done to rule out other conditions that can cause sun sensitivity, such as
    lupus erythematosus. Phototesting (trying to reproduce the rash by testing the skin with different amounts and wavelengths of
    ultraviolet and visible light) is sometimes helpful too.


<h3>Can PLE be cured?</h3>
<p>No treatment will get rid of PLE forever. However, many people remain clear if they avoid exposure to the sun and use an effective sunscreen.
    The tendency to get PLE may go away by itself after a few years.</p>

     <h2>How can PLE be treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    When the rash comes up, a corticosteroid cream or ointment may help to
    settle it.
    <br><br>
    Mild PLE may be controlled by following the ‘top sun safety tips’ listed below
    in the ‘Self care (What can I do?)’ section below.
   <br><br>
    If very troublesome, desensitisation treatment may be considered.
    Desensitisation is a way of raising the skin’s resistance by treating it with
    increasing doses of ultraviolet light in a special phototherapy cubicle. The
    treatment is given in the early spring so that the skin is ready to cope with the
    summer sun. The effect of desensitisation treatment wears off in the winter,
    so it should be repeated every spring.
    <br><br>
    A few people with extensive PLE may still have problems despite the
    measures listed above. Some tablets (such as hydroxychloroquine), which are
    usually prescribed for malaria, may be helpful in some cases. A short course
    of oral steroids can be considered at times, e.g. to cover a summer holiday. If
    very resistant to the treatments mentioned above, other oral non-steroidal
    agents like azathioprine can also be used.

     <h2>Self care (What can I do?)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    <ul>
    <li>Strictly follow the ‘top sun safety tips’ as well as the vitamin D advice
        mentioned below.</li>
    <li>Ask the doctor for a referral to a dermatologist to consider
        phototherapy desensitisation therapy.</li>
    <li>Spend time in the shade between 11am and 3pm when it’s sunny.
        Seek shade from the sun before the skin has a chance to redden or
        burn. </li>
    <li>When choosing a sunscreen look for a high protection SPF (SPF 30 or
        above) to protect against UVB, and the UVA circle logo and/or 4 or 5
        UVA stars to protect against UVA. Apply plenty of sunscreen 15 to 30
        minutes before going out in the sun, reapply every two hours and
        straight after swimming and towel-drying. </li>
    <li>Sunscreens should not be used as an alternative to clothing and
        shade, rather they offer additional protection. No sunscreen will provide
        100% protection. </li>
    <li>The British Association of Dermatologists recommends that the doctor
        is informed about any changes to a mole or patch of skin. If the GP is
        concerned about the skin, make sure a referral to a Consultant
        Dermatologist is made. </li>
    <li>Taking Vitamin D supplement tablets (available from health food
        shops) may be helpful as strictly avoiding sunlight can reduce Vitamin
        D levels.
