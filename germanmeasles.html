        <h2>What is German Measles (Rubella)?</h2>


<p>
German measles, also known as rubella, is a viral infection that causes a red rash 
on the body. Aside from the rash, people with German measles usually have a fever 
and swollen lymph nodes. The infection can spread from person to person through 
contact with droplets from an infected person’s sneeze or cough. This means that 
you can get German measles if you touch your mouth, nose, or eyes after touching 
something that has droplets from an infected person on it. You may also get German 
measles by sharing food or drinks with someone who’s infected.
<br><br>
German measles is rare in the United States. With the introduction of the rubella 
vaccine in the late 1960s, the incidence of German measles significantly declined. 
However, the condition is still common in many other parts of the world. It mainly 
affects children, more commonly those between 5 and 9 years old, but it can also 
occur in adults.
<br><br>
German measles is typically a mild infection that goes away within one week, even 
without treatment. However, it can be a serious condition in pregnant women, as it
 may cause congenital rubella syndrome in the fetus. Congenital rubella syndrome 
 can disrupt the development of the baby and cause serious birth defects, such as 
 heart abnormalities, deafness, and brain damage. It’s important to get treatment 
 right away if you’re pregnant and suspect you have German measles.

     <h2>Causes of German Measles</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
German measles is caused by the rubella virus. This is a highly contagious virus 
that can spread through close contact or through the air. It may pass from person 
to person through contact with tiny drops of fluid from the nose and throat when 
sneezing and coughing. This means that you can get the virus by inhaling the droplets 
of an infected person or touching an object contaminated with the droplets. 
German measles can also be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her developing 
baby through the bloodstream.
<br><br>
People who have German measles are most contagious from the week before the rash 
appears until about two weeks after the rash goes away. They can spread the virus 
before they even know that they have it.

    <h2>Symptoms of German Measles</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The symptoms of German measles are often so mild that they're difficult to notice.
 When symptoms do occur, they usually develop within two to three weeks after the 
 initial exposure to the virus. They often last about three to seven days and may
 include:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>pink or red rash that begins on the face and then spreads downward to the rest of the body</li>
<li>mild fever, usually under 102°F</li>
<li>swollen and tender lymph nodes</li>
<li>runny or stuffy noseli>
<li>headache</li>
<li>muscle pain</li>
<li>inflamed or red eyes</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
Although these symptoms may not seem serious, you should contact your doctor if you 
suspect you have German measles. This is especially important if you’re pregnant or 
believe you may be pregnant.
<br><br>
In rare cases, German measles can lead to ear infections and brain swelling. Call your 
doctor immediately if you notice any of the following symptoms during or after a 
German measles infection:
 <ul>
<li>prolonged headache</li>
<li>earache</li>
<li>stiff neck</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Who Is at Risk for German Measles?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
German measles is extremely rare in the United States, thanks to vaccines that 
typically provide lifelong immunity to the rubella virus. Most cases of German 
measles occur in people who live in countries that don't offer routine immunization 
against rubella.
<br><br>
The rubella vaccine is usually given to children when they’re between 12 and 15 
months old, and then again when they’re between ages 4 and 6. This means that 
infants and young toddlers who haven’t yet received all vaccines have a greater 
risk of getting German measles.
<br><br>
To avoid complications during pregnancy, many women who become pregnant are given a 
blood test to confirm immunity to rubella. It’s important to contact your doctor 
immediately if you've never received the vaccine and think you might have been 
exposed to rubella.

    <h2>How German Measles Affect Pregnant Women</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
When a woman contracts German measles during pregnancy, the virus can be passed 
on to her developing baby through her bloodstream. This is called congenital 
rubella syndrome. Congenital rubella syndrome is a serious health concern, as 
it can cause miscarriages and stillbirths. It can also cause birth defects in 
babies who are carried to term, including:
<br><br>
 <ul>
<li>delayed growth</li>
<li>intellectual disabilities</li>
<li>heart defects</li>
<li>deafness</li>
<li>poorly functioning organs</li>
</ul>
Women of childbearing age should have their immunity to rubella tested before
 becoming pregnant. If a vaccine is needed, it’s important to get it at least 
 28 days before trying to conceive.

    <h2>German Measles Diagnosis</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Since German measles appears similar to other viruses that cause rashes, your 
doctor will confirm your diagnosis with a blood test. This can check for the 
presence of different types of rubella antibodies in your blood. Antibodies 
are proteins that recognize and destroy harmful substances, such as viruses 
and bacteria. The test results can indicate whether you currently have the 
virus or are immune to it.

    <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
German measles is generally mild, and an affected child can be cared for at home.
 <ul>
<li>To relieve discomfort and fever, give the child acetaminophen (Tylenol®) 
or ibuprofen.</li>
<li>Avoid contact between the child and any woman who might be pregnant. 
If there is contact, tell the woman to call her doctor for advice.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>German Measles Treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Most cases of German measles are treated at home. Your doctor may tell you to 
rest in bed and to take<b> acetaminophen (Tylenol)</b>, which can help relieve discomfort
 from fever and aches. They may also recommend that you stay home from work or
 school to prevent spreading the virus to others.
<br><br>
Pregnant women may be treated with <b>antibodies called hyperimmune globulin </b>that can 
fight off the virus. This can help reduce your symptoms. However, there’s still a 
chance that your baby will develop congenital rubella syndrome. Babies who are 
born with congenital rubella will require treatment from a team of specialists. 
Talk to your doctor if you’re concerned about passing German measles on to your baby.

    <h2>How To Prevent German Measles</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
For most people, vaccination is a safe and effective way to prevent German measles. 
The rubella vaccine is typically combined with vaccines for the measles and mumps as 
well as varicella, the virus that causes chicken pox.
<br><br>
These vaccines are usually given to children who are between 12 and 15 months old. 
A booster shot will be needed again when children are between ages 4 and 6. Since 
the vaccines contain small doses of the virus, mild fevers and rashes may occur.
<br><br>
If you don’t know whether you’ve been vaccinated for German measles, it’s important 
to have your immunity tested, especially if you:

 <ul>
<li>are a woman of childbearing age and aren’t pregnant</li>
<li>attend an educational facility</li>
<li>work in a medical facility or school</li>
<li>plan to travel to a country that doesn’t offer immunization against rubella</li>
</ul>

While the rubella vaccine usually isn’t harmful, the virus in the shot could cause 
adverse reactions in some people. You shouldn’t be vaccinated if you have a weak 
immune system due to another illness, are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant 
within the next month.
