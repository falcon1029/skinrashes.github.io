        <h2>What is Bedsores (Pressure Ulcers)?</h2>
Bedsores (pressure ulcers), also known as pressure sores or decubitus 
ulcers, result from prolonged pressure that cuts off the blood supply 
to the skin, causing the skin and other tissue to die. The damage may 
occur in as little time as 12 hours of pressure, but it might not be 
noticed until days later when the skin begins to break down. The skin 
is especially likely to develop pressure sores if it is exposed to rubbing 
(friction) and moving the skin in one direction and the body in another 
(shear), as in sliding down when the bed head is raised. Dampness (such as 
from perspiration or incontinence) makes the skin even more liable to 
develop pressure sores.

      <h2>Stages of Decubitus Ulcers</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
<p>
Decubitus ulcers occur in stages. The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel 
(NPUAP) has a staging process to help your doctor diagnose and treat you:
</p>


<h3>Stage 1</h3>
<p>
The skin isn’t broken, but it’s discolored. The area may appear red if you have a 
light complexion. The discoloration may vary from blue to purple if you have a dark 
complexion. It may appear white.
</p>

<h3>Stage 2</h3>
<p>
The skin is open and shows signs of some tissue death around the wound. The ulcer 
is shallow with a red pink wound bed. There might also be a blister filled with fluid.
</p>

<h3>Stage 3</h3>
<p>
The ulcer is much deeper within the skin. It affects your fat layer and looks like a 
crater. There also might be something that looks like pus in the sore.
</p>

<h3>Stage 4</h3>
<p>
Many layers are affected in this stage, including your muscle and bone. A dark
 substance called “eschar” may be inside the sore.
</p>

<h3>Unstageable</h3>
<p>
The ulcer may be yellow or green. It can be soft and look like pus, or it can have a 
brown scab covering. If the damage to your tissue layers is extensive, it will need to 
be removed. However, if the covering of the ulcer is dry and stable, it shouldn’t be 
removed because it’s your body’s natural layer of protection.

      <h2>What Causes a Decubitus Ulcer?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Pressure is one of the main causes of a decubitus ulcer. Lying on a certain part 
of your body for long periods may cause your skin to break down. Your skin is 
thinner in places next to bone or cartilage, and your hips, heels, and tailbone 
are especially vulnerable to pressure sores.
<br><br>
 Decubitus ulcers can also happen when you scrape or rub your skin against a hard 
 or rough surface. Friction burns on the skin may damage the outermost layer of 
 skin cells, called the “epidermis.”
<br><br>
Wearing soiled clothing or undergarments for long periods may create open sores on 
the skin. This may irritate the delicate outer skin layer.

      <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
There are a number of risk factors for decubitus ulcers:
<ul>
    <li>You may be at risk if you can’t move or change positions by yourself 
	while lying in bed or sitting in a wheelchair.
	         <ul>
          <li>Spinal cord injury</li>
          <li>Paralysis</li>
	      <li>Strokes</li>
	      <li>Nerve (neurologic) disease</li>
		  <li>Decreased mental awareness</li>
            </ul>
	                                     </li>
    <li>Your skin may be more fragile and delicate if you’re an older adult, 
	which can put you at increased risk.</li>
	<li>Poor eating habits or not getting enough nutrients in your diet may 
	influence the condition of your skin, which can increase your risk. This 
	includes not drinking enough water to keep your skin hydrated and to
	prevent dryness.</li>
	<li>Conditions like diabetes may restrict your blood circulation, 
	which can cause tissue destruction in your skin and increase your risk.</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Symptoms of a Decubitus Ulcer</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

Each stage of a decubitus ulcer has different symptoms. Depending on the stage, 
you may have any of the following:

<ul>
    <li>skin discoloration</li>
    <li>pain in the affected area</li>
	<li>infection</li>
	<li>skin that doesn’t lighten to the touch</li>
	<li>open skin</li>
	<li>skin that is softer or firmer than the surrounding skin</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Diagnosing a Decubitus Ulcer</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Your doctor may refer you to a wound care team of doctors, specialists, 
and nurses experienced in treating pressure sores. The team may evaluate 
your ulcer based on several things. These include:
<ul>
    <li>the size and depth of your ulcer</li>
    <li>the type of tissue directly affected by your ulcer, such as skin, muscle, or bone</li>
	<li>the color of the skin affected by your ulcer</li>
	<li>the amount of tissue death that occurs from your ulcer</li>
	<li>the condition of your ulcer, such as presence of infection, foul odor, and bleeding</li>
</ul>

Your doctor may take samples of the fluids and tissue in your decubitus ulcer. 
In addition, they may look for signs of bacteria growth and cancer.

      <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Do not attempt self-care for any ulcer beyond stage 2 in appearance.
<br><br>
In the early stages (1 and 2) of bedsores, the area may heal with relief of 
pressure and by applying care to the affected skin.
<br><br>
A good diet will aid skin healing, especially by taking in enough vitamin C 
and zinc, which are available as supplements.
<br><br>
For effective skin care:

<ul>
    <li>If the skin is not broken, gently wash the area with a mild soap and water.</li>
    <li>Clean open sores on the skin with salt water (saline, which can be made by 
	boiling 1 quart of water with 1 teaspoon of salt for 5 minutes and kept 
	cooled in a sterile container).</li>
	<li>Apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly (Vaseline®) and then cover with a
	soft gauze dressing.</li>
	<li>Be sure to keep urine and stool away from affected areas.</li>
</ul>
To relieve pressure:
<ul>
    <li>Change positions often (every 15 minutes in a chair and every 2 hours in a bed).</li>
    <li>Use special soft materials or supports (pads, cushions, and mattresses) to 
	reduce pressure against the skin.</li>
	
</ul>

      <h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
If a stage 2 bedsore does not begin to heal in a few days, or if the sore is at 
stage 3 or above, seek medical advice.
<br><br>
Get immediate care if you notice signs of infection (fever, spreading redness, 
swelling, or pus).

      <h2>Treating a Decubitus Ulcer</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Your treatment will depend on the stage of your ulcer. Treatment can include 
medications, therapies, and even surgery.
<br><br>
Antibacterial drugs may treat the infection. You may also receive medication 
to relieve or reduce any discomfort.
<br><br>
A process to remove dead tissue called “debridement” is an option for cleaning 
your wound.
<br><br>
Keeping the site clean and free of debris is important to promote healing. Your
 doctor may order frequent dressing changes of your wound..

      <h2>Outlook</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Your healing process depends on the stage of your ulcer. Treatment is usually less 
difficult if the ulcer is diagnosed in the first two stages. Your doctor may suggest 
that you change your diet and increase your fluid intake to help you recover faster.
 Later stages often require more aggressive treatments and longer recovery times.
