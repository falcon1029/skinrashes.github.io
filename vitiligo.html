<h2>What is vitiligo?</h2>

<p>
    Vitiligo is a condition in which areas of skin lose their normal pigment and so become white.
    It is common, and affects about 1% of the world’s population.

    <h2>What causes vitiligo?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The pigment that gives your skin its normal colour is melanin, which is made by cells known as melanocytes.
    The cause of vitiligo is not yet fully known but many think that it is a disease in which the body makes
    antibodies to its own melanocytes, and in doing so destroys them. After that, the skin cannot make melanin
    properly, and vitiligo is the result. In support of this idea is the way that people with vitiligo are more
    likely than others to have diseases, caused in much the same way, of other organs such as the thyroid.
<br><br>
    It affects men and women of all races equally, but is most easy to see in people with dark skins. It is not catching.

    <h2>Is vitiligo hereditary?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Only about a fifth of people with vitiligo know of someone in their family who has it; but the exact type
    of inheritance has not yet been worked out. One problem here is that so many people have no idea if their
    relatives are hiding vitiligo under their clothing.

    If you have vitiligo, it does not follow that your children are sure to get it too.


<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>
    There is no medical evidence of any dietary link and vitiligo. Therefore no dietary changes are recommended.

    <h2>What are the symptoms of vitiligo?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    These fall into two groups:<br><br>

    The sun burns the pale areas very easily. This is sore, and when the burn has settled down, the pale areas
    of vitiligo will stand out, more strikingly than before, against a background of tanned skin.<br><br>

    Many people become embarrassed or depressed by the look of their vitiligo, and by the questions that
    other people ask them about it.

    <h2>What does vitiligo look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

<ul>

    <li>The most common sites for vitiligo are:</li>
    <li>The exposed areas – vitiligo often begins on the hands and face.</li>
    <li>Around body openings: the eyes, nostrils, mouth, umbilicus, and genitals.</li>
    <li>In body folds: the armpits and groin.</li>
    <li>Anywhere your skin has been damaged, for example by a cut or a burn.</li>
    <li>Areas around pigmented moles (as part of “halo naevi”).</li>

</ul>
    In one rare (segmental) type, vitiligo crops up on just one part of the body.
<br><br>
    Although vitiligo not more common in people with a dark skin is it much more obvious. Premature greying of the
scalp hair can accompany vitiligo.

    <h2>Course of the disease</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Vitiligo can start at any age, but about half of those who get it do so before they are 20. Its course is
    hard to predict, but it tends to progress slowly, with periods of stability, often lasting several years.
    The patches slowly change their shape and size, and the skin around them may be darker than normal.
    The hairs growing out of a patch of vitiligo may keep their normal colour or turn white too.
<br><br>
    Some pigment comes back in a few patients but seldom does so completely. If it returns via the hair follicles,
    the areas do not look much better when they turn from white to speckled.
</div>
</div>



<div class="card">
    <div class="header">
    <h2>How will vitiligo be diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The diagnosis is usually easy to make on the basis of the look of the patches (white with a normal skin texture)
    and the fact that the areas of vitiligo on the left side of the body roughly mirror those on the right.
    An ultraviolet light  (Wood's lamp) can help to show up white areas that could have been missed in a pale-skinned person.
<br><br>
    Once the diagnosis of vitiligo has been made, your doctor may want to check you for thyroid disease,
    and for other autoimmune conditions that are more common than usual in people with vitiligo.

<h3>Can vitiligo be cured?</h3>

<p>
    Vitiligo occasionally goes away by itself, and some treatments may slow its progress, but a cure cannot be guaranteed.

    <h2>How can vitiligo be treated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    There are a number of treatment options that can be discussed with your GP
    or dermatologist. Often no treatment may be required other than good sun
    protection, especially in pale-skinned individuals, and skin camouflage creams
    and powder.
<ul>
    <li><b>Sunscreens. </b>Areas of vitiligo will burn easily in the sun. The use of a
        sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher to all
        exposed areas helps to protect skin affected by vitiligo, and also, when
        applied more widely, reduces the contrast between the areas of vitiligo
        and the surrounding normal skin. Other standard sun protection
        measures, such as appropriate protective clothing and sun avoidance
        should also be employed (see the 'top sun safety tips' below for more
        information).</li>
    <li><b>Topical corticosteroids. </b>The application of a potent or very potent
        corticosteroid anti-inflammatory cream or ointment to areas of vitiligo
        may restore some pigment. Side effects, such as thinning of the skin and
        stretch marks, are a risk with continued use. Short courses of oral
        steroids can sometimes be considered but may be associated with side
        effects such as weight gain, skin thinning, mood changes and cataracts.</li>
    <li><b>Other topical preparations. </b>Other types of anti-inflammatory creams
        and ointments, such as calcineurin inhibitors and vitamin D analogues,
        may also restore pigment in some patients. These topical treatments will
        help avoid the corticosteroid side effect of skin thinning.
    </li>
    <li><b>Phototherapy </b>This involves exposing affected skin to artificial
        ultraviolet light. Phototherapy may be helpful in a proportion of patients
        with vitiligo. However, treatment often needs to be prolonged (lasting at
        least several months). Full repigmentation is unusual and
        depigmentation after phototherapy can occur. Areas such as the
        fingertips and the skin around the lips are less likely to improve (see
        Patient Information Leaflet on Phototherapy). Phototherapy may also be
        used in combination with topical or oral corticosteroid treatments.</li>
    <li><b>Surgical treatment. </b>This process involves transplanting small areas of
        normal skin into areas of stable vitiligo. This method of treatment is still
        being developed and is not yet in general use.
    </li>
    <li><b>Laser treatment.</b>Some areas of vitiligo have improved from treatment
        with a laser called the Excimer laser. This treatment appears to work
        best on vitiligo that has not changed for a long time and affects relatively
        small areas of skin. Laser treatment can sometimes be used in
        combination with topical treatments.</li>
    <li><b>Removing the remaining pigment.</b>If vitiligo has spread very widely
        (more than 50% of the body) or involves large areas of the face or hands,
        it may in exceptional circumstances be reasonable to consider removing
        the small amounts of pigmented areas of skin using a bleaching
        chemical such as hydroquinone. The emotional, social and medical
        implications must be carefully discussed before this treatment is used
        and it should only be undertaken with specialist supervision.</li>
    <li><b>Psychological treatments</b>Professional help with developing coping
        mechanisms may be helpful for some people with vitiligo or their carers
        e.g. parents.</li>
    <li><b>Skin camouflage.</b>Advice from experts about skin camouflage is now
        widely available. There are good quality camouflage products in a range
        of colours that are water resistant and less likely to rub off. Your GP or
        dermatologist can advise or refer you to a camouflage service for this.
        Careful use of fake suntans can be effective to make areas of vitiligo less
        noticeable.</li>

    <h2>Self care (What can I do?)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

    <ul>
    <li>Protect your exposed skin with clothing, and don’t forget to wear a hat
        that protects your face, neck and ears, and a pair of UV protective
        sunglasses.
    </li>
    <li>Spend time in the shade between 11am and 3pm when it’s sunny</li>
    <li>When choosing a sunscreen look for a high protection SPF (SPF 30 or
        more) to protect against UVB, and the UVA circle logo and/or 4 or 5 UVA
        stars to protect against UVA. Apply plenty of sunscreen 15 to 30 minutes
        before going out in the sun, and reapply every two hours and straight
        after swimming, towel-drying and strenuous exercise.</li>
    <li>Sunscreens should not be used as an alternative to clothing and shade,
        rather they offer additional protection. No sunscreen will provide 100%
        protection. Keep babies and young children out of direct sunlight as far
        as possible. It may be necessary to take Vitamin D supplement tablets
        as strictly avoiding sunlight can reduce Vitamin D levels. You should ask
        your doctor or dermatologist about this.</li>
