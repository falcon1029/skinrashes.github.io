    <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Skin tags are very common, and their incidence increases with age. Seen more often 
in people with growth hormone excess (acromegaly), skin tags are sometimes associated 
with acanthosis nigricans, a condition in which areas of skin may become thickened and velvety.

    <h2>Is a skin tag a tumor?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Skin tags are a type of harmless skin growth or benign tumor. Tags are generally not 
cancerous (malignant) and don't become cancerous if left untreated.<br><br>



There are extremely rare instances where a skin tag may become precancerous or cancerous. 
Skin tag-like bumps that bleed, grow, or display multiple colors like pink, brown, red, 
or black can require a biopsy to exclude other causes, including skin cancer.

    <h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Skin tags are benign in nature, and, therefore, no treatment is necessary. However, 
you should seek evaluation from a primary care provider or dermatologist if you are
 either uncertain of the diagnosis or if the skin tags become irritated or painful.

    <h2>Treatments</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
It is important to keep in mind that skin tags usually do not have to be treated. 
Deciding not to get rid of a skin tag is always a reasonable option if the growths
 are not bothersome. If the tags are bothersome, multiple home and medical treatment
 methods are available:


 <ul>
    <li>Snipping with scissors.</li>
    <li>Freezing with liquid nitrogen (cryosurgery).</li>
	<li>Destroying it with an instrument providing a small of amount of electrical 
	current (electrodesiccation).</li>
	<li>Tie off the tag at its narrow base with a piece of dental floss or string.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Will removing a skin tag cause more to grow?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
There is no evidence that removing a skin tag will cause more tags to grow. 
There is no expectation of causing skin tags to "seed" or spread by removing them. 
In reality, some people are simply more prone to developing skin tags and may have 
new growths periodically. Some individuals request periodic removal of tags at annual 
or even quarterly intervals.

<h3>Are skin tags contagious?</h3>
<p>
No. There is no evidence to suggest that common skin tags are contagious

    <h2>Do any creams remove skin tags?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
There are no currently medically approved creams for the removal of skin tags. 
Skin tags are typically removed by physical methods like cutting off or tying off 
with dental floss. It is not advisable to use unapproved products like Dermasil, 
wart removers, tea tree oil, nail polish, toothpaste, or hair-removal creams like
 Neet or Nair. Trial uses of unapproved creams may cause irritation and possible 
 secondary complications.

    <h2>Skin tag or wart?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Compared to warts, skin tags are:
<ul>
    <li>smooth and soft (warts tend to be rougher with an irregular surface)</li>
    <li>knobbly and hang off the skin (warts are usually slightly raised or flat)</li>
	<li>not contagious (warts spread very easily, so a sudden outbreak or 
	cluster of growths is more likely to be warts)</li>
  </ul>
