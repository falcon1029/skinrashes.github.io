       <h1>Actinic Keratosis (Solar Keratosis)</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>What is Actinic Keratosis?</h2>
Actinic keratoses, also known as solar keratoses, are small rough or scaly 
areas of skin due to damage from sun exposure. Some actinic keratoses can turn 
into squamous cell skin cancer, so it is important to perform self-examinations 
often and catch them early.<br><br>

       <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
People with fair skin who sunburn easily; have trouble tanning; have blue, 
green, or hazel eyes; and red or blond hair are most at risk for developing 
actinic keratoses. Those who have had a lot of sun exposure in their youth 
are at a high risk as well. Those with a weak immune system due to chemotherapy, 
HIV, or an organ transplant are at higher risk.<br><br>

Spots usually appear in those who are older (over 50), but they can start 
appearing in younger adults who have had a lot of sun exposure. Darker-skinned 
individuals are rarely affected.

       <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The sun-exposed areas of the face, scalp (where balding), ears, neck, forearms, 
and backs of the hands are most commonly affected with actinic keratoses, but any 
skin area frequently exposed to sun can be involved.<br><br>

Patches are usually less than an inch in size with slight scale (sometimes thick 
like a wart) and a pink, red, or brownish color. They are slightly rough to the 
touch, like fine sandpaper, and may be a bit sensitive.

<ul>
    <li>Mild ,one or two spots, not thick or hard</li>
    <li>Moderate ,scattered, few spots</li>
    <li>Severe,numerous or thick, hard, or bleeding spots</li>
    
</ul>

       <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Prevention is very important. Sun protection can reduce the number of 
new areas occurring and may help small lesions go away on their own. 

<ul>
<li>Avoid direct sun in the middle of the day (10 AM to 3 PM). 
Remember: snow and water reflect light to the skin, and clouds still 
let a lot of light through, so you may still be exposed to ultraviolet 
light even on cloudy days.</li>
<li>Use a hat with a wide brim. A baseball hat does not give much protection.</li>
<li>Cover up with tightly woven clothing. Some manufacturers make specialty 
clothing with a high sun protection factor (SPF) rating, or you can purchase 
a special ingredient to be added to your washer that can "wash" SPF into
 your clothing.</li>
<li>Use sunscreen on all exposed skin areas, including the lips, before 
going outdoors. A broad spectrum (blocks UVB and UVA light), with an SPF 
of at least 30, is best. Apply generously 30 minutes before going outdoors 
and reapply every 2 hours or after swimming or sweating a lot.</li>
<li>Do not use tanning beds!</li>
<li>A low-fat diet (less than 21% calories from fat) has been shown to 
reduce the incidence of actinic keratoses.</li>

</ul>
Once a month, you should perform a self-exam to look for signs of skin 
cancer. It is best to perform the exam in a well-lit area after a shower 
or bath. Use a full-length mirror with the added assistance of a hand mirror, 
when necessary. Using a hair dryer can help you examine any areas of skin 
covered by hair, such as your scalp.
<ul>
    <li>In front of a full-length mirror, inspect the front of your body 
	making sure to look at the front of your neck, chest (including under breasts), 
	legs, and genitals.</li>
    <li>With your arms raised, inspect both sides of your body making sure 
	to examine your underarms.</li>
    <li>With your elbows bent, examine the front and back of your arms as 
	well as your elbows, hands, fingers, area between your fingers, 
	and fingernails.</li>
    <li>Inspect the tops and bottoms of your feet, the area between 
	your toes, and toenails.</li>
    <li>With your back to the mirror and holding a hand mirror, inspect the back 
	of your body, including the back of your neck, shoulders, legs, and buttocks.</li>
    <li>Using a hand mirror, examine your scalp and face.</li>

</ul>
As you perform your monthly self-exam, familiarize yourself with the moles, freckles, 
and other marks on your body, and look for any changes in them from month to month, 
including shape, size, color, or other changes, such as bleeding or itching.

       <h2>When to seek Medical Care?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
If you have severe changes or have a spot that is growing or bleeding, see the doctor.
 Sometimes a biopsy may be done to look for skin cancer.

       <h2>Treatments</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
 <ul>
              <li>Local destruction with freezing (cryosurgery), scraping 
			  (curettage), burning (electrocautery), dermabrasion, or a laser</li>
              <li>Creams with either tretinoin, adapalene, fluorouracil, diclofenac, 
			  or imiquimod</li>
              <li>Chemical peeling</li>
			  <li>Photodynamic therapy</li>
	</ul>

</p>
<h3>Medication</h3>
<p>
Treatment for more advanced or widespread cases of actinic keratosis includes 
medication in the form of various creams and gels. Some medicated creams include:

 <ul>
              <li>diclofenac gel</li>
              <li>imiquimod cream</li>
              <li>fluorouracil cream</li>
			  <li>ingenol mebutate gel</li>
</ul>
These creams and gels are applied directly to affected areas of the skin. 
They may produce side effects in some people who may experience rashes, 
redness, and swelling at the site of application.
</p>

<h3>Surgery</h3>
<p>
In cases where a person only has a few spots or patches, a doctor may recommend 
removing the affected area through minor surgery. Two of the more common surgery
 options are curettage and cryotherapy.<br><br>

Scraping, which is referred to as curettage, involves a device called a curette,
 to scrape off the damaged skin cells. In some cases, electrosurgery is used 
 immediately after scraping. Electrosurgery involves a doctor using a pen-shaped 
 instrument, to destroy and cut away the affected tissue with an electric current.
<br><br>
Both procedures require a local anesthetic. Some people experience side effects,
 including scarring, discoloration, and infection.
<br><br>
Freezing, referred to as cryotherapy, removes the lesions by freezing them with
 liquid nitrogen. A doctor applies the liquid nitrogen to the skin when the 
 extreme cold causes the affected area to blister and peel. As the skin heals,
 the lesions fall off, allowing new, undamaged skin to appear.
<br><br>
Cryotherapy is the most common treatment for actinic keratosis. This is partly
 because it can be done in the doctor's office and takes only a few minutes. 
 Side effects may include:
 
  <ul>
              <li>changes to skin texture</li>
              <li>blisters</li>
              <li>infection</li>
			  <li>scarring</li>
			  <li>discoloration of the skin at the site of treatment</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Photodynamic therapy</h3>
<p>
Photodynamic therapy involves the application of a chemical to the affected 
areas of skin. The doctor then shines an artificial light on the chemical, 
which, in turn, kills the damaged cells and removes the actinic keratosis.
<br><br>
Side effects may include redness, swelling, and burning, which may be felt 
during the procedure.
<br><br>
A person and their doctor will work together to decide the best option or 
options. In some cases, a person may have regular treatment for recurring 
patches.

       <h2>Prevention</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The main methods of prevention of actinic keratosis are through lifestyle changes 
and a person being aware of their exposure to UV rays.
<br><br>
A person should take proper precautions when outside, such as wearing hats, 
loose-fitting clothes that cover most areas of the body, and sunscreen.
<br><br>
They may want to avoid being in the sun for prolonged periods of time, as well.
<br><br>
People should avoid excessive exposure to UV light from tanning either indoors 
or outdoors.
<br><br>
It is important to remember that this condition may occur from any source of
 UV light, including indoor tanning beds

       <h2>Outlook</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Actinic keratosis is a marker of severe skin changes and damage to the skin, as 
a result of UV exposure. These changes put a person with actinic keratosis at 
high risk for developing skin cancer.<br><br>

People who catch actinic keratosis early tend to have a good chance of removing
 the risk of developing cancer. However, if left untreated, actinic keratosis
 may develop into skin cancer.<br><br>

Once treated for actinic keratosis, a person will probably need to schedule
 yearly dermatologist appointments, to screen for recurrence and check 
 for other signs of skin cancer.<br><br>
