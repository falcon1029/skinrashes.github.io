    <div class="container">
        <h2>What is Allergic Contact Dermatitis?</h2>
Allergic contact dermatitis is an allergy to a substance (the allergen) touching 
the skin. The reaction occurs 48–72 hours after exposure. Common allergens are nickel,
 chromates, rubber chemicals, and neomycin (an antibacterial medication).
 <br><br>

 <ul>
    <li>Nickel is found in jewelry, belt buckles, and metal closures on clothing.</li>
    <li>Chromates are found in shoe leathers.</li>
	<li>Rubber chemicals are found in gloves, balloons, and elastic in clothes.</li>
	<li>Neomycin is common in triple-antibiotic first-aid ointments such as Neosporin
	(and generic versions of Neosporin) as well as other combination preparations 
	containing other antibacterials and corticosteroids, as well as other topical 
	ointments, creams, and lotions. It may also be found in eye medications, 
	eardrops, and some vaccines.</li>
	<li>Common allergen-containing products include cosmetics, soaps, dyes, and jewelry.</li>
	<li>The most frequent triggers are fragrance, nickel, neomycin, formaldehyde, lanolin, 
	and other chemicals that are common in the environment.</li>
	<li>Poison ivy is a frequent cause and is discussed separately.</li>
</ul>

       <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Allergic contact dermatitis can occur at any age, but it is more common in adults, with
 women affected more often than men.

       <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Allergic contact dermatitis may occur anywhere on the body. Exposed areas such as 
the arms, legs, and face are most often affected. Scaly red-to-pink sheets of skin 
(plaques) and blisters may appear. Individual lesions have distinct (well-demarcated) 
borders and often assume shapes with straight edges and right angles. Eyelid swelling 
frequently occurs when the allergen is transferred from your child's finger to his or
 her eyelid. Affected areas are usually severely itchy.
<br><br>
When the dermatitis is long-standing, thickened plaques develop, and infection with 
bacteria may occur.

       <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Actinic cheilitis most commonly affects the lower lip (90%), and causes:
 <ul>
    <li>Avoid whatever is triggering the dermatitis.</li>
    <li>Apply cool water compresses to cleanse the area, and then apply over-the-counter 
	0.5–1% hydrocortisone cream twice daily.</li>
	<li>Calamine lotion and oral antihistamines (chlorpheniramine or diphenhydramine) 
	may reduce the itching.</li>
	
</ul>

       <h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
See your child's doctor or a dermatologist for evaluation if the rash does not heal
 or keeps coming back, and it does not improve with self-care measures.
</div>
</div>


<div class="card">
    <div class="header">
       <h2>Treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
 <ul>
    <li>Treatment is aimed at preventing contact with the allergen. Symptoms may be 
	controlled with oral antihistamines.</li>
    <li>Medium-potency topical steroids may be prescribed for rash occurring on the
	arms or legs (extremities) or trunk.</li>
	<li>Mild-potency topical steroids may be prescribed for use on the thinner 
	skin of the face and skin-fold areas.</li>
	<li>Use the lowest potency topical steroids for the shortest period of time necessary.</li>
	<li>The doctor may do patch testing for allergies if the cause is not known.</li>
	
</ul>

       <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
In the early stages, AC might just look and feel like very chapped lips. 
If you notice something on your lip that feels scaly, looks like a burn, 
or turns white, you should see a doctor. If you don’t have a dermatologist, 
your primary care doctor can refer you to one if necessary.
<br><br>
A dermatologist is usually able to diagnose AC just by looking at it, along 
with a medical history. If they want to confirm the diagnosis, they might do 
a skin biopsy. This involves taking a small piece of tissue from the affected 
part of your lip for lab analysis.

      <h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Seek the evaluation of a primary care provider or dermatologist when persistent 
scaling of the lips is noted. A biopsy of the lip may be needed to rule out 
squamous cell carcinoma.

</div>
</div>

    <div class="header">
      <h2>Treatments</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
In severe cases without evidence of malignancy, a lip shave procedure 
(vermilionectomy) may be performed. In less extreme cases, your physician 
may recommend destruction (ablation) of the damaged cells with a carbon 
dioxide (CO2) laser.
<br><br>
Alternative treatments include the use of electric current to destroy the 
precancerous cells (electrodesiccation) and a facial sanding technique 
(dermabrasion). Topical therapy with a chemotherapeutic agent (fluorouracil) 
or a topical immunomodulator (imiquimod) may be prescribed.

     <h2>Complications</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
If Actinic cheilitis isn’t treated, it could turn into a type of skin cancer called 
squamous cell carcinoma. While this only happens in a small percentage 
of Actinic cheilitis cases, there is no way to tell which will turn into cancer. 
Therefore, most cases of Actinic cheilitis are treated.<br><br>

Actinic cheilitis is a pre-malignant condition. It predisposes to:

 <ul>
    <li>Intraepidermal carcinoma (Bowen disease or squamous cell carcinoma in situ)</li>
    <li>Invasive squamous cell carcinoma</li>

</ul>
Cancer of the lip is more common in smokers than in non-smokers. Other factors 
include oncogenic human papillomavirus (wart virus), alcohol abuse and 
immunosuppression.<br><br>

Invasive squamous cell carcinoma should be suspected if the lip is focally 
tender, or a persistent ulcer or enlarging nodule develops.

     <h2>Prevention</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Actinic cheilitis can be prevented by protecting the lips from sun exposure. 
In smokers, the risk of cancer can be reduced by smoking cessation.
<br><br>
These are similar to ways to protect yourself from sun damage in general:

 <ul>
    <li>Wear a hat with a wide brim that shades your face.</li>
    <li>Use lip balm with an sun proof of at least 15. Put it on before you
	go into the sun, and reapply it often.</li>
	<li>Take breaks from the sun when possible.</li>
	<li>Avoid being outside in midday, when the sun is strongest.</li>

</ul>

     <h2>Outlook for actinic cheilitis</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Actinic cheilitis can improve with effective sun protection and treatment. 
Continued sun exposure and lack of treatment increase the risk of squamous 
cell carcinoma, which is potentially life threatening.
