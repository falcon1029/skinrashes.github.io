        <h2>What is Acne Keloidalis  Nuchae?</h2>
Acne keloidalis nuchae, also known as keloidal folliculitis or nuchal
 keloidal acne, is a chronic skin condition characterized by inflamed bumps 
 and scars on the back of the neck.<br><br>

Although it is not related to common acne (acne vulgaris), acne keloidalis 
nuchae initially appears as acne-like lesions of inflamed hair follicles 
(folliculitis) on the nape of the neck (nuchal area) and, without treatment, 
can result in large scars (keloids).

    </div>

    <div class="container">
Acne keloidalis nuchae is most commonly found in young adult men of African or, 
less commonly, Latino or Asian descent. It is very uncommon in women. In addition, 
acne keloidalis nuchae is very rarely seen in people prior to puberty or after middle age.

       <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The most common locations of acne keloidalis nuchae include:

<ul>
    <li>Back of the neck (posterior neck)</li>
    <li>Lower back of the scalp (occipital scalp)</li>
  </ul>
  
  Initially, lesions of acne keloidalis nuchae appear as red or pus-filled bumps, 
  which may be tender or itchy. Over time, these inflamed bumps develop into small scars. 
  Without treatment, the small scars can coalesce into large, thick scars, or keloids. 
  Areas of widespread scarring may be associated with hair loss. Rarely, advanced acne
  keloidalis nuchae lesions can develop deep pockets of pus with connections to the
  surface of the skin, and a foul-smelling discharge may ooze from these sinus tracts.

       <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
People who develop acne keloidalis nuchae should focus on avoiding irritation to the area
 in order to prevent the formation of additional lesions:
 
 <ul>
    <li>Wash the area gently with non-irritating cleansers (no hard scrubbing!).</li>
    <li>Avoid head wear (such as sports helmets) and shirt collars that rub against 
	the back of your neck.</li>
	<li>Avoid closely shaving of the back of your neck.</li>
    <li>For itchy lesions, try an over-the-counter cortisone cream.</li>
  </ul>
  Generally, persons with acne keloidalis nuchae should see their primary care 
  doctor or a dermatologist for treatment in order to prevent progression of the condition.
