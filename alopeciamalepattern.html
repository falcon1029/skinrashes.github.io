        <h2>What is Male Pattern Baldness?</h2>
Male pattern baldness (alopecia), or androgenetic alopecia, is the patterned 
balding of a man. Although the condition may affect both the appearance and 
self-esteem of some men, one should note that the condition is not a medical
 disorder. The hair loss is non-scarring and has a genetic basis. Sex steroids 
 (androgens) – specifically, dihydrotestosterone – play a role in this form of 
 balding.
 <br><br>
According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM), more than 50 percent 
of all men over the age of 50 will be affected by male pattern baldness to some extent.

       <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Male pattern baldness can begin in your teenage years, but it more commonly
 occurs in adult men, with the likelihood increasing with age. Genetics 
 plays a big role. Men who have close relatives with male pattern baldness 
 are at a higher risk. This is particularly true when their relatives are 
 on the maternal side of the family.
 <br><br>
Male pattern baldness may be hastened by other forms of hair loss, such as 
chemotherapy-induced hair loss. Likewise, male pattern baldness becomes 
more common as age increases.

       <h2>What causes male pattern baldness?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
One cause of male pattern baldness is genetics, or having a family history 
of baldness. Research has found that male pattern baldness is associated 
with male sex hormones called androgens. The androgens have many functions, 
including regulating hair growth.
<br><br>
Each hair on your head has a growth cycle. With male pattern baldness, this 
growth cycle begins to weaken and the hair follicle shrinks, producing shorter 
and finer strands of hair. Eventually, the growth cycle for each hair ends and 
no new hair grows in its place.
<br><br>
Inherited male pattern baldness usually has no side effects. However, sometimes
 baldness has more serious causes, such as certain cancers, medications, thyroid 
 conditions, and anabolic steroids. See your doctor if hair loss occurs after taking
 new medications or when it’s accompanied by other health complaints.
<br><br>
Doctors use the pattern of hair loss to diagnose male pattern baldness. They may
 perform a medical history and exam to rule out certain health conditions as the 
 cause, such as fungal conditions of the scalp or nutritional disorders.
<br><br>
Health conditions may be a cause of baldness when a rash, redness, pain, peeling 
of the scalp, hair breakage, patchy hair loss, or an unusual pattern of hair loss
 accompanies the hair loss. A skin biopsy and blood tests also may be necessary 
 to diagnose disorders responsible for the hair loss.

       <h2>Am I losing my hair?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
If your hair loss begins at the temples or the crown of the head, you may have 
male pattern baldness. Some men will get a single bald spot. Others experience 
their hairlines receding to form an “M” shape. In some men, the hairline will 
continue to recede until all or most of the hair is gone.

       <h2>Techniques to address hair loss</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Medical treatment isn’t necessary if other health conditions aren’t a cause. 
However, treatments are available for men who are unhappy with the way they 
look and would like the appearance of a fuller head of hair.


<h3>1.Hairstyles</h3>
<p>
Men with limited hair loss can sometimes hide hair loss with the right 
haircut or hairstyle. Ask your hairstylist for a creative cut that will 
make thinning hair look fuller.
</p>

<h3>2.Wigs or hairpieces</h3>
<p>
Wigs can cover thinning hair, receding hairlines, and complete baldness. 
They come in a variety of styles, colors, and textures. For a natural look,
 choose wig colors, styles, and textures that look similar to your original
 hair. Professional wig stylists can help style and fit wigs for an even
 more natural look.
</p>
<h3>3.Weaves</h3>
<p>
Hair weaves are wigs that are sewn into your natural hair. You must have enough 
hair to sew the weave into. The advantage to weaves is they always stay on,
 even during activities such as swimming, showering, and sleeping. 
 The disadvantages are they must be sewn again whenever new hair growth
 occurs, and the sewing process can damage your natural hair.
</p>
<h3>4.Minoxidil (Rogaine)</h3>
<p>
Minoxidil (Rogaine) is a topical medication applied to the scalp. Minoxidil 
slows hair loss for some men and stimulates the hair follicles to grow new hair. 
Minoxidil takes four months to one year to produce visible results. Hair loss often 
happens again when you stop taking the medication.
<br><br>
Possible side effects associated with minoxidil include dryness, irritation, 
burning, and scaling of the scalp. You should visit the doctor immediately if 
you have any of these serious side effects:

 <ul>
    <li>weight gain</li>
    <li>swelling of the face, hands, ankles, or abdomen</li>
	<li>trouble breathing when lying down</li>
	<li>rapid heartbeat</li>
	<li>chest pain</li>
    <li>labored respiration</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>5.Finasteride (Propecia, Proscar)</h3>
<p>
Finasteride (Propecia, Proscar) is an oral medication that slows hair loss in some men. 
It works by blocking the production of the male hormone responsible for hair loss. 
Finasteride has a higher success rate than minoxidil. When you stop taking finasteride,
your hair loss returns.
<br><br>
You must take finasteride for three months to one year before you see results. 
If no hair growth occurs after one year, your doctor will likely recommend that 
you stop taking the medication. The side effects of finasteride include:

 <ul>
    <li>depression</li>
    <li>itching</li>
	<li>rash</li>
	<li>hives</li>
	<li>breast tenderness</li>
    <li>breast growth</li>
	<li>swelling of the face or lips</li>
	<li>painful ejaculation</li>
	<li>pain in testicles</li>
    <li>difficulty getting an erection</li>
	</ul>
Although it’s rare, finasteride can cause breast cancer. You should have any breast
 pain or lumps evaluated by a doctor immediately.
<br><br>
Finasteride may affect prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests used to screen for prostate 
cancer. The medication lowers PSA levels, which causes lower-than-normal readings. 
Any rise in PSA levels when taking finasteride should be evaluated for prostate cancer.
</p>

<h3>6.Hair transplants</h3>
<p>
A hair transplant is the most invasive and expensive treatment for hair loss. Hair 
transplants work by removing hair from areas of the scalp that have active hair 
growth and transplanting them to thinning or balding areas of your scalp.
<br><br>
Multiple treatments are often necessary, and the procedure carries the risk of 
scarring and infection. The advantages of a hair transplant are that it looks 
more natural and it’s permanent.
</p>

<h3>7.Counseling</h3>
<p>
Going bald can be a big change. You may have trouble accepting your appearance. 
You should seek counseling if you experience anxiety, low self-esteem, depression, 
or other emotional problems because of male pattern baldness.

       <h2>Can hair loss be prevented?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
There’s no known way to prevent male pattern baldness. A theory is that stress 
may cause hair loss by increasing the production levels of sex hormones in the 
body. You can reduce stress by participating in relaxing activities, such as 
walking, listening to calming music, and enjoying more quiet time.

       <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
The most common location for male pattern baldness occurs at the frontal hairline. 
Hair loss may move toward the back of the scalp (posteriorly), or it may be first
 noted as thinning at the crown of the scalp. While the underlying scalp may 
 appear normal, a man might see miniaturized hair follicles.

       <h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Male pattern baldness is not a medical disorder and does not require therapy. 
However, cosmetic restorative therapy may be sought, based upon personal desire.

       <h2>Treatment</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
Hair loss in male pattern baldness is non-scarring, so the hair follicles are not 
destroyed. A population of cells remain that can grow and enlarge the hair. 
The only clinically proven pharmacologic methods to prevent loss are minoxidil 
(a topical medication) and finasteride (an oral medication). However, with 
discontinued use of the products, accelerated hair loss may occur.
<br><br>
Scalp reduction or hair transplantation therapies are effective surgical procedures, 
but they can become expensive and should only be performed by a qualified dermatologic 
surgeon or plastic surgeon.
