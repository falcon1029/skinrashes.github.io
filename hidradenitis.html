<h2>What is hidradenitis suppurativa?</h2>

<p>
    Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic and stubborn disease centred on inflammation of the large specialised
    sweat glands (apocrine glands) that are found mainly in the armpits and groins. These areas show a
    distinctive mixture of boil-like lumps, areas leaking pus, and scarring.<br><br>
    Hidradenitis suppurativa is a long term, recurrent, and painful disease in which there is inflammation
    (redness, tenderness and swelling) in areas of skin containing apocrine sweat glands. These glands are
    found mainly in the armpits, breasts and groins. Within HS there is a blockage of the hair follicles.

    It is still not clear why the apocrine sweat glands are affected like this in some people, but mechanical
    blockage plays a part. As the secretions cannot escape, the tubes containing them may swell up and burst,
    or become infected.

     <h2>Contributory factors include the following:</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    Hormones are involved in the control of apocrine sweat glands and certainly play a part in the disease.
    Hidradenitis suppurativa affects women more often than men. It does not start before puberty or after the menopause.
    It may get better during pregnancy, but is often worse before menstrual periods. Some patients do well with hormone
    treatments (see below).
    Bacteria play a part too, but a variety of germs, and not just one special type, is found in the spots.
    It is not clear whether they cause the disease, or just flourish within it.
    There may be a link with acne.


<h3>Is hidradenitis suppurativa hereditary?</h3>
<p>
    Hidradenitis suppurativa sometimes runs in families, and some patients or family members may also have had
    bad acne, or a chronic abscess at the base of the spine (a pilonidal sinus).
</p>

<h3>Can hidradenitis suppurativa be cured?</h3>
<p>
    No, it usually persists for many years, but may disappear eventually. Treatment usually helps even though it
    cannot switch the hidradenitis off once and for all.
</p>

<h3>What are the symptoms of hidradenitis suppurativa?</h3>
<p>
    Hidradenitis suppurativa can be itchy, but is usually painful, and the lumps hurt if they are pressed.

     <h2>What does hidradenitis suppurativa look like?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The severity of hidradenitis suppurativa varies from person to person. The main areas to be affected are
    the armpits, and the skin around the genitals - in the pubic area and in the groins. The skin around the
    back passage, on the upper buttocks and thighs, and below the breasts, can be affected too.
<br><br>
    In these areas, the skin shows a variable mixture of blackheads, red lumps looking like boils, pus spots,
    cysts, and areas that constantly leak pus (sinuses). The abscesses can even burrow into nearby structures.
    As time goes by, more and more scarring appears.

     <h2>How will hidradenitis suppurativa be diagnosed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    The diagnosis is made from the appearances of the rash and by taking into account the areas of distribution.
    Your doctor may take swabs from the area to see which type of germ is present.

    Treatment is tailored for each individual. In general terms, early onset of HS is usually treated medically,
    whereas more longstanding and severe HS may benefit from surgical intervention, especially if there are various affected sites.
</p>
<h3>What treatment is available for a sudden flare of HS, such as a new painful boil?</h3>
<p>

    <ul>
    <li> A warm flannel applied to the affected skin or taking a bath may encourage drainage of pus</li>
    <li>Painkillers, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), can help with the pain and inflammation</li>
    <li>A course of antibiotics may be needed if there is any evidence of infection</li>
    <li>Surgical treatment to lance a boil (incision & drainage of the pus)</li>
    <li>A steroid injection into the boil is sometimes considered by dermatologists</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Medical treatment to try to prevent flares of HS:</h3>
<p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Antibacterial lotions and washes:</b> Patients are frequently prescribed an antiseptic such as 4% chlorhexidine wash,
        to reduce the spread of bacteria on the skin. An antibiotic lotion such as clindamycin may be recommended for affected skin.</li>
    <li><b>Antibiotic tablets:</b> These may be prescribed for a prolonged time in order to try to help suppress further attacks.
        Tetracycline antibiotics such as lymecycline and doxycycline are often tried initially. The combination of clindamycin
        and rifampicin is another option; potential side effects include an upset stomach, orange tears and urine, and reduced
        effectiveness of the oral contraceptive pill. In HS, antibiotics may work by suppressing inflammation rather than by
        killing bacteria.</li>
    <li><b>Retinoids (vitamin A derived tablets) </b>such as acitretin may help too, but are given with caution by specialists,
        so they are available only from dermatology clinics. Women who have taken acitretin should avoid pregnancy for
        three years afterwards and so this treatment is usually avoided in women of child-bearing age.</li>
    <li>For women who have flares of HS before each period, tablets known as anti-androgens can sometimes be useful.
        Anti-androgen treatment can be as part of a <b>contraceptive pill.</b></li>
    <li><b>Tablets to alter the immune system:</b> some tablets such as dapsone and ciclosporin may be considered to try to
        improve HS by dampening down the immune system. Benefits are balanced against potential side effects and blood test
        monitoring is needed.</li>
    <li><b>Immuno-suppressive injections:</b>Injection treatments designed to suppress the immune system are used for HS that
        has not improved with other medical treatment. These ‘biologic’ treatments include adalimumab, injected under the skin,
        and infliximab, given as an intravenous infusion.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Surgical treatment:</h3>
<p>

<ul>
    <li>Persistent discharge or inflammation in the same site despite medical treatment can sometimes require surgery,
        either to remove small areas of repeated inflammation, or wider procedures to take away all the affected tissue.
        The wider procedures probably reduce the chance of HS coming back in the treated area, compared to smaller procedures,
        but healing times are generally longer.</li>
